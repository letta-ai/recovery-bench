    "state_analysis": "The permissions for both '/data/output/' and 'raw_data.txt' have been correctly set, allowing the necessary read and execute access. Despite this, the 'process_data.sh' script continues to fail with a 'cannot execute: required file not found' error. This likely indicates that the script is unable to find or access the 'raw_data.txt' file, even though it appears to exist in the directory with the correct permissions.",
    "explanation": "I will check the shebang line of 'process_data.sh' to ensure it is using the correct interpreter (bash). Additionally, I will try to run 'process_data.sh' directly to see if it provides any more specific error messages. This could help identify if there's an issue with the script itself or if there's an environmental problem affecting its execution.",
