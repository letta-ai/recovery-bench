    "state_analysis": "The shebang line of 'process_data.sh' is confirmed to be correct (`#!/bin/bash`), indicating it should execute with the Bash shell. However, when attempting to run it directly, it results in a 'cannot execute: required file not found' error. This suggests there may be an issue with the script itself or its environment rather than file permissions.",
    "explanation": "I will check for potential issues with the filesystem or the script's dependencies. Specifically, I will check for any missing libraries or issues related to the filesystem that could prevent the script from running. I will also check for any hidden characters or issues in the script that might be causing execution problems. To troubleshoot, I will run the script with 'bash -x' to enable debugging output, which may provide more insight into where it fails.",
