    "state_analysis": "The 'run_pipeline.sh' script is present and seems to be well-structured with error checking after each step. However, the 'collect_data.sh' script has permissions set to executable for the owner only, which means it cannot be executed by the pipeline unless run by the owner. This could lead to a failure at the first step of the pipeline if run by a non-owner. The other scripts have the proper permissions.",
    "explanation": "I will change the permissions of 'collect_data.sh' to make it executable by all users, allowing the pipeline to run successfully. After that, I will attempt to run the 'run_pipeline.sh' script again to see if it executes without errors.",
