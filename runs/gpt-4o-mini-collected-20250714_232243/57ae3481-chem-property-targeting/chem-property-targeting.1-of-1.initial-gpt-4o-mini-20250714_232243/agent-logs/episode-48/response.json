This indicates that the system environment is not configured for typical package management. Additionally, pip is still not available for Python 3.11, as confirmed by the error when trying to use it.",
    "explanation": "I will create a virtual environment for Python 3.11. This virtual environment will allow me to install pip and RDKit without interfering with the system Python installation. After setting up the virtual environment, I will install RDKit and then run the solution_chem_agent.py script to verify its functionality.",
