    "state_analysis": "The contents of the solution_chem_agent.py script have been displayed, revealing that the code structure is correct. However, the use of '**props,'** in the candidates.append statement is likely causing the SyntaxError because Python does not support unpacking dictionary entries in that manner within a list. This needs to be changed to ensure proper dictionary construction.",
    "explanation": "I will correct the script to fix the SyntaxError by replacing the unpacking method. After making the changes, I will run the script again to confirm it functions as intended.",
