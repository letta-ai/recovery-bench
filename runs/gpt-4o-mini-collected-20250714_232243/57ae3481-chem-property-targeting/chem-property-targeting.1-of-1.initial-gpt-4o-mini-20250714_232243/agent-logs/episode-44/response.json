This suggests that the terminal environment is not properly executing the command, even though the RDKit package appears to be installed.",
    "explanation": "I will escape the exclamation mark in the print statement to avoid the shell issue. I will also use an alternative method to check if RDKit can be imported successfully. After confirming that RDKit works, I will run the solution_chem_agent.py script again to verify its functionality.",
