    "state_analysis": "The modifications to the solution_chem_agent.py script using sed have not resolved the unpacking issue in the code. As a result, the code still contains incorrect syntax related to the unpacking of the 'props' dictionary, which is causing the persistent SyntaxError when trying to execute the script.",
    "explanation": "I will manually edit the script to ensure that the properties from 'props' are added to the dictionary being appended without using unpacking. I will explicitly include each property in the candidates.append statement. After these corrections, I will run the script again to check its functionality.",
