As a result, pip remains unavailable for Python 3.11, which is necessary for managing additional packages like RDKit.",
    "explanation": "I will try using wget to download the get-pip.py script instead of curl, which should allow me to install pip for Python 3.11. After installing pip, I will install RDKit and then run the solution_chem_agent.py script again to verify its functionality.",
