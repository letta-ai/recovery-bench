    "state_analysis": "The attempt to start QEMU with the QCOW2 disk image 'alpine-disk.qcow2' and logging enabled has resulted in the process being stopped. This suggests that there may be a fundamental issue with either the image itself or the QEMU configuration as it fails to run with all tested configurations.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to start QEMU lead to it being stopped, we should try to create a new Alpine Linux image from scratch or use a known good image if possible. However, since that requires an image source and additional tools that may not be available, we will attempt one final approach by running QEMU with a minimal configuration and providing it with an explicit command to check for errors. We will also use a simple boot command to see if we can get any output.",
