    "state_analysis": "The attempt to start QEMU with the QCOW2 image 'alpine-disk.qcow2' in default mode has also led to the process being stopped. This indicates that there remains an issue preventing QEMU from successfully running, likely due to either the image file itself or the QEMU configuration in this environment.",
    "explanation": "Since none of the attempts to boot QEMU have been successful, we can conclude that the issue may be due to the QCOW2 image being corrupted or incompatible with the current setup. As a next step, we will try a different approach by attempting to create a new temporary image or use a different known good image if available. However, since that might not be possible in the current environment, we will check if there are any alternative methods to initialize or reset the QEMU environment.",
