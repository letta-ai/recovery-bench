The persistent error regarding the inability to gain a write lock on the image suggests that some process or configuration is preventing QEMU from accessing the image files properly.",
    "explanation": "At this point, it is essential to reset or troubleshoot the environment further. Since we cannot identify any running processes due to the absence of the 'ps' command, it may be useful to attempt a restart of the terminal session or the entire container if possible. This would clear any lingering locks on the QCOW2 files and may allow QEMU to run successfully after the environment has been reset. If restarting is not an option, we may need to consider using a completely different environment or virtualization setup.",
