    "state_analysis": "The persistent locking issue with QEMU images has not been resolved despite numerous attempts to run QEMU with different configurations and images. The repeated messages indicate that the environment continues to face conflicts that prevent QEMU from starting successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since options for troubleshooting in the current environment are limited and the locking issue has not been cleared, the most effective solution is to restart the terminal session or the container. This will help clear any locks on the image files and potentially allow QEMU to run successfully afterward. If restarting is not possible, using a different environment for QEMU operations should be considered as a viable alternative.",
