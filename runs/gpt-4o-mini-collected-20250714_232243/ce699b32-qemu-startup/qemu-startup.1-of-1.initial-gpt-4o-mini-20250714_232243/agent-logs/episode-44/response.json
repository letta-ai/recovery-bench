    "state_analysis": "The persistent locking problems with QEMU images have not been resolved, despite multiple attempts to run QEMU from different configurations and images. The environment appears to be unable to correctly manage the image files, leading to ongoing failures.",
    "explanation": "As the situation remains unchanged and there are no further options for troubleshooting within the current environment, the only effective solution is to restart the terminal session or the container. This should clear any locks on the images and allow QEMU to function as intended. If restarting is not feasible, consider transitioning to a different environment that supports QEMU operations without these conflicts.",
