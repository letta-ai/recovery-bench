    "state_analysis": "The repeated failures to start QEMU with both the existing and newly created QCOW2 images indicate a persistent issue likely caused by a locked image or a misconfiguration within the environment. Despite moving to a new directory and creating a new image, the inability to run QEMU suggests that there may also be environmental factors at play.",
    "explanation": "Given that we cannot identify any processes that might be locking the image files, and that restarting the environment is not an option, we have reached the limits of what can be done in this scenario. It is advisable to either restart the terminal session or, if applicable, the entire container to clear any locks on the images. If restarting is not feasible, consider using a different host or virtualization platform that allows for a fresh setup and proper management of QEMU instances.",
