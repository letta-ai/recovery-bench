    "state_analysis": "The attempt to start QEMU with the QCOW2 disk image 'alpine-disk.qcow2' has also resulted in the process being stopped. This suggests that there may be a fundamental issue with the QEMU configuration, the environment, or the image itself.",
    "explanation": "Given that all attempts to run QEMU have led to it being stopped, it is likely that the issue is not just with the image format but possibly related to the environment's compatibility with QEMU. We will now try to run QEMU without any images, to determine if the problem lies solely with the images or if QEMU itself cannot run in this environment. This will help us assess the state of QEMU and if it can initiate a basic session without any attached images.",
