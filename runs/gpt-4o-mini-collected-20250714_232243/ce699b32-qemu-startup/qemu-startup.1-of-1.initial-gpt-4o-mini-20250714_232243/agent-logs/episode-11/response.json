    "state_analysis": "All attempts to start QEMU, including with the BIOS option, have resulted in the process being stopped. This points to a fundamental issue with QEMU's ability to run in this environment, possibly due to a lack of resources or compatibility with the existing setup.",
    "explanation": "Given that all configurations lead to failure, it is likely that the environment is either not properly set up for running QEMU or the 'alpine.iso' is not valid. There are no available commands to troubleshoot further (e.g., checking the image or process status). Therefore, we will provide a command to list the contents of the current directory, which may help in verifying the presence of the required image file or any related files.",
