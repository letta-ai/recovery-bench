    "state_analysis": "The issue with QEMU being unable to acquire write locks on the images is still unresolved, and repeated messages highlight the need for a clear reset of the environment. The persistent locking problem suggests that some underlying process or configuration is preventing QEMU from functioning correctly.",
    "explanation": "As the current troubleshooting options have been exhausted and no further progress can be made without restarting the terminal session or container, the most effective course of action is to initiate a restart. This will help clear any locks that are currently held on the images and allow QEMU to operate correctly thereafter. If restarting is not possible, using a different environment for running QEMU should be considered to avoid these persistent issues.",
