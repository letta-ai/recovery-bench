    "state_analysis": "All attempts to start the QEMU process continue to result in it being stopped. The warnings related to the image format persist, and any commands to verify or check the status of processes are unavailable, meaning there is no way to confirm whether QEMU is actually starting successfully.",
    "explanation": "Given the repeated failures to start QEMU with the current Alpine ISO and the lack of necessary commands in this environment, we should consider the possibility that the Alpine ISO image might be corrupted or incompatible. However, since we cannot check its validity or install necessary utilities, we will try to run QEMU with a different command that might bypass the issues we are encountering. We will attempt to start QEMU without specifying a drive or image, just using a simple command to see if the process can launch without issues.",
