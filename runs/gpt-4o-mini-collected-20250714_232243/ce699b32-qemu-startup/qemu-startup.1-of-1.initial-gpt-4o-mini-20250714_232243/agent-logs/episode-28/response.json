    "state_analysis": "All attempts to start QEMU with both the original and newly created QCOW2 images continue to fail due to a locking issue. This situation persists despite moving to a new directory, indicating that there may be a persistent process or configuration problem that is not being resolved by simply copying files or changing directories.",
    "explanation": "Since we cannot identify or terminate processes holding onto the images and have exhausted the options available in the current environment, the best course of action is to restart the terminal session or the entire container. This should clear any locks on the image files and allow QEMU to run successfully. If that is not possible, it may be necessary to explore other virtualization solutions or environments that provide the required tools and commands for effective management.",
