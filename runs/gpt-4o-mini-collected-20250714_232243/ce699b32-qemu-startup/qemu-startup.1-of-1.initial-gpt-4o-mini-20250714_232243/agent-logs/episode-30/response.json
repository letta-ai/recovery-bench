    "state_analysis": "All attempts to run QEMU with various configurations and images continue to fail, indicating a persistent locking issue with the QCOW2 images. Despite moving to a new directory and creating new images, the underlying issue remains unresolved, likely due to a process or configuration that is not accessible in this environment.",
    "explanation": "Given the consistent failure and the inability to identify or terminate any processes holding locks on the image files, the most effective solution at this point is to restart the terminal session or the container. This will clear any locks and potentially resolve the issue. If restarting is not feasible, consider switching to a different virtualization environment or testing platform that allows for a fresh setup and proper management of QEMU instances.",
