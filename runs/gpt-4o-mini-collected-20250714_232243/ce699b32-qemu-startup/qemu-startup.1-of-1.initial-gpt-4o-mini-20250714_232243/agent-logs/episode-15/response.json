    "state_analysis": "The installed version of QEMU is 5.2.0, which is a relatively recent version. However, the fact that all attempts to run QEMU have resulted in the process being stopped suggests there may still be an underlying issue with either the environment configuration, resource limitations, or potential incompatibility with the images being used.",
    "explanation": "Given that we have confirmed the QEMU version, we will now attempt to run a simple command to check if the environment itself has any limitations, such as CPU or memory. This could help identify if the environment is preventing QEMU from starting properly. We will check the available resources of the system to assess if they meet the requirements for running QEMU.",
