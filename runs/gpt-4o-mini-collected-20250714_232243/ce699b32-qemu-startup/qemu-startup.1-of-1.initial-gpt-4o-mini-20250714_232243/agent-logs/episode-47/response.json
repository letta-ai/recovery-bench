    "state_analysis": "The inability to run QEMU continues, with persistent write lock issues on the QCOW2 images despite repeated attempts to run from different directories and with new images. The environment does not allow for effective troubleshooting or process management, indicating a significant limitation in addressing the problem.",
    "explanation": "Given the ongoing failures and the lack of available tools to manage or check for processes that may be locking the images, the most effective recommendation remains to restart the terminal session or the container. This will clear any locks on the images and potentially resolve the underlying issues with QEMU. If restarting is not feasible, using a different environment for QEMU operations should be considered as a viable alternative to avoid these conflicts.",
