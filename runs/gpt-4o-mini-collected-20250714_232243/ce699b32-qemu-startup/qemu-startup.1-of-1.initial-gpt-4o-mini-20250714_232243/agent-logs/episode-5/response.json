The warnings indicate that the image format is not set correctly, and host forwarding is failing to establish.",
    "explanation": "Since we cannot utilize networking commands or verify the QEMU process, we will attempt to start the QEMU instance with the required image format again. This time we will use a more basic configuration without any networking options to see if it can start properly. After starting the image, we will run a command to check if the QEMU process is active by simply echoing a message, as we cannot use commands like 'ps'.",
