Though we attempted to start QEMU with the raw format specified, it still fails to run properly. The necessary commands for checking processes and networking are still not available in this environment.",
    "explanation": "Since repeated attempts to run QEMU with the specified parameters have failed, we will try to run the QEMU command with a simpler configuration, avoiding any network options or complexities. This will help us determine if the issue is strictly related to the networking setup or the image itself. We will also suppress the network warnings and focus on getting the QEMU to start without host forwarding.",
