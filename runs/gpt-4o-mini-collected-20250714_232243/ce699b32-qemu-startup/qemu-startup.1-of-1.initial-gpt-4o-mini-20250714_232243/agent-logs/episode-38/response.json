    "state_analysis": "The persistent locking issues with QEMU images remain unresolved, and all attempts to run QEMU have failed due to write lock errors. The repeated suggestions to restart the terminal session or container highlight the inability to clear any potential locks that might be held on the image files.",
    "explanation": "Given the ongoing issues and the lack of tools available to identify or terminate locking processes, the best option is to restart the terminal session or the container. This should help clear any locks and allow QEMU to function properly. If this is not possible, using a different environment for running QEMU would be advisable to avoid these persistent conflicts.",
