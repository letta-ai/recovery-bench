    "state_analysis": "The repeated failures to run QEMU with both the original and newly created QCOW2 images indicate an unresolved locking issue. Even after creating a new QCOW2 image and attempting to run it in a new directory, the process is still unable to gain a write lock, suggesting that some process is still holding onto the image or that configuration issues persist.",
    "explanation": "Given that we have exhausted all available methods to troubleshoot and resolve the locking issue, the best course of action is to restart the terminal session or the container hosting the QEMU instance. This will help clear any locks on the images and potentially resolve the underlying issue. If restarting is not feasible, testing in a different environment or virtualization setup may be necessary to effectively run QEMU without these conflicts.",
