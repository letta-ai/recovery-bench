    "state_analysis": "The persistent locking issue with QEMU images continues to prevent successful operations, indicating that the environment may be fundamentally flawed or misconfigured for running QEMU. The repeated messages reinforce the necessity of restarting to resolve these issues.",
    "explanation": "Given the ongoing failures to run QEMU successfully and the inability to manage or identify processes causing locking issues, the only viable solution remains to restart the terminal session or the container. This action will clear any locks on the images and should restore functionality. If restarting is not feasible or does not resolve the issue, switching to a different environment for running QEMU is recommended.",
