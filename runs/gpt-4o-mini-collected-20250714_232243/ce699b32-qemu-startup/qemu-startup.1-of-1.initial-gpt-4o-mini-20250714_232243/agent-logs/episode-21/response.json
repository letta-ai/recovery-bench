    "state_analysis": "The commands to check for running QEMU processes and to kill them failed because the necessary commands are not available in the environment. This means we cannot directly manage any potential QEMU processes that might be locking the QCOW2 image.",
    "explanation": "Since we cannot check for or terminate QEMU processes, we will try to restart the terminal session or the environment itself to clear any locks on the image. If that is not possible, we can try to create a new, temporary directory to work in and run QEMU from there, which might help avoid any issues with locking on the original image. We will create a new directory and attempt to copy the image into it, then run QEMU from that location.",
