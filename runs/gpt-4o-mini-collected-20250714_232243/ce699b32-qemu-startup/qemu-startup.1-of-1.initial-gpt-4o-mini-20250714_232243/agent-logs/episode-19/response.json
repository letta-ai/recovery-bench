    "state_analysis": "All attempts to start QEMU with various configurations, including running with the QCOW2 image and disabling display, have resulted in the process being stopped. This indicates persistent issues with either the QEMU setup or the images being used, possibly due to incompatibility or corruption.",
    "explanation": "Since previous methods have not yielded any success, I recommend verifying the integrity of the 'alpine-disk.qcow2' image file. If the image file is intact, the next logical step would be to try a different image, such as a different version of Alpine Linux or another Linux distribution altogether. However, since we are limited in our current environment, we will attempt to run QEMU with the QCOW2 image but this time without the serial output and with a more verbose logging option to capture any underlying issues that might occur during the boot process.",
