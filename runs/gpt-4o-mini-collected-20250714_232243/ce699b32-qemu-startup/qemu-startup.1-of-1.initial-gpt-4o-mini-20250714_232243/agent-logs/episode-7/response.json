    "state_analysis": "The QEMU process continues to stop regardless of the configuration changes made. The persistent warning about the image format suggests that there is an underlying issue with the image file itself. Additionally, the lack of available commands for process viewing and networking is limiting progress.",
    "explanation": "Given that the QEMU process is repeatedly stopping and there are no tools to check its status, we will attempt to run a simpler command to see if the issue lies with the image itself. We will try to start QEMU with a minimal configuration and check for any errors directly. We will also add an explicit command to check the image format using 'file' command on the ISO.",
