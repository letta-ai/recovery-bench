    "state_analysis": "The situation remains unchanged, with all attempts to run QEMU resulting in a failure to obtain a write lock on the QCOW2 images. Despite creating a new image and trying from a different directory, the persistent locking issue indicates a deeper problem, likely stemming from the environment or unidentifiable processes.",
    "explanation": "Given that repeated efforts to resolve the locking issue with the QCOW2 images have not been successful and that we cannot check for or terminate processes within this environment, the next logical step is to restart the terminal session or the entire container. This should clear any locks that might be held by lingering processes. If restarting is not an option, consider using a different environment or virtualization host that allows for proper management of QEMU instances and troubleshooting.",
