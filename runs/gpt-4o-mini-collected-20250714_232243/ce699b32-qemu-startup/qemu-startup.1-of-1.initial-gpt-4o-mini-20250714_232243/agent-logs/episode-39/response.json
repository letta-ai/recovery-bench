    "state_analysis": "The persistent inability to run QEMU with the QCOW2 images continues, with repeated write lock errors indicating that some process may still be holding onto the images. The environment does not provide the necessary tools to manage or troubleshoot running processes effectively, leading to a deadlock situation.",
    "explanation": "Given the repeated failures and the inability to resolve the locking issues, it is crucial to restart the terminal session or the container to clear any locks on the image files. This is the only remaining option to potentially allow QEMU to operate as expected. If restarting is not feasible, consider using a different environment for running QEMU to avoid these persistent problems.",
