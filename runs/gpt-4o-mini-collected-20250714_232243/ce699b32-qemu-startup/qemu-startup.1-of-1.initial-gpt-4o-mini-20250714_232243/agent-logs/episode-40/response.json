    "state_analysis": "The persistent locking issue with QEMU images remains unresolved, as attempts to run QEMU with the QCOW2 images continue to fail. This indicates that there may still be a process holding onto the images, or that the environment configuration is not suitable for running virtual machines.",
    "explanation": "As the environment does not provide the necessary commands to troubleshoot or terminate processes that may be holding locks on the images, the best recommendation is to restart the terminal session or the entire container. This will clear any locks on the images and potentially allow QEMU to function as expected. If restarting is not feasible, using a different environment for running QEMU would be advisable.",
