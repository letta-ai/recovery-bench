    "state_analysis": "The QEMU process has been stopped again due to issues with the image format and the inability to set up the host forwarding rule. Both 'netstat' and 'ss' commands are not available, indicating that necessary network utilities are missing in this environment.",
    "explanation": "Since we cannot use networking commands to check listening ports and are facing issues with QEMU\u2019s configuration, we will modify our approach. We will attempt to start QEMU with the image format explicitly set and without any networking options to check if it runs successfully. After starting the image, we will also include a check to see if the QEMU process is running in the background.",
