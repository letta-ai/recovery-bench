    "state_analysis": "The situation remains unchanged, with ongoing issues related to QEMU's inability to acquire write locks on the images. The repeated messages emphasize the need for a reset of the environment to clear any locks that may be preventing QEMU from functioning correctly.",
    "explanation": "Since there have been no successful attempts to resolve the locking issues and the environment lacks the tools necessary for effective troubleshooting, the best recommendation is to restart the terminal session or the container. This will help eliminate any locks on the image files. If restarting is not possible, it is advisable to consider using a different environment for running QEMU to avoid these persistent issues.",
