    "state_analysis": "The creation of a new QCOW2 image was successful, but attempts to use the existing 'alpine-disk.qcow2' image continue to fail due to a locking issue. This reinforces the idea that some process is likely holding a lock on the original image, preventing new QEMU instances from accessing it.",
    "explanation": "Given that the original image is locked and we have successfully created a new QCOW2 image, we can now attempt to start QEMU using the newly created image. This should avoid the locking issue and allow us to see if QEMU can run successfully with a fresh image. We will initiate QEMU with the new image and monitor for any errors during startup.",
