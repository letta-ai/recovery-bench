The presence of 'alpine.iso' indicates that the image is available, but it may still be corrupt or incompatible given the continual errors when trying to run it in QEMU.",
    "explanation": "Since we have confirmed that 'alpine.iso' exists, we can attempt to use 'alpine-disk.qcow2' as an alternative disk image to boot QEMU. The QCOW2 format is often more flexible and may avoid some of the issues seen with the raw ISO. We will try to start QEMU using 'alpine-disk.qcow2' instead of 'alpine.iso'.",
