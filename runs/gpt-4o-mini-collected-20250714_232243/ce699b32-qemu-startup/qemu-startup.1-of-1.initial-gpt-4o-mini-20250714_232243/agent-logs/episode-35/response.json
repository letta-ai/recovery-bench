    "state_analysis": "The persistent issue with QEMU being unable to start due to write lock failures continues, indicating that there may still be an unseen process holding locks on the QCOW2 images. Despite attempts to move to a new directory and create new images, the problem remains unresolved.",
    "explanation": "Since troubleshooting options are limited and the environment does not allow for checking or terminating processes, the best recommendation is to restart the terminal session or the container to clear any locks on the images. If that is not possible, consider switching to a different environment for running QEMU, as the current setup is unable to function correctly under these conditions.",
