    "state_analysis": "The ongoing locking issues with QEMU images have not been resolved, as attempts to run the newly created QCOW2 image and the previous image continue to fail. The environment is consistently unable to allow QEMU to access the images due to write lock failures.",
    "explanation": "Since the inability to run QEMU has persisted despite numerous attempts, the best recommendation remains to restart the terminal session or the container. This action should clear any locks on the image files and allow QEMU to function correctly. If restarting is not an option, using a different environment for running QEMU should be considered as a viable alternative to avoid these persistent issues.",
