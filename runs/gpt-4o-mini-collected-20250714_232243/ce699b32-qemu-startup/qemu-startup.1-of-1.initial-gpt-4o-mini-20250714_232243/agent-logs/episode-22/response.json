    "state_analysis": "The attempt to start QEMU with the QCOW2 image 'alpine-disk.qcow2' from the new directory has also resulted in the process being stopped. This indicates that the issue is likely not related to the directory or file permissions, but rather with QEMU's ability to run the image itself or a persistent issue with the environment.",
    "explanation": "Since the previous approaches have consistently failed, we can try to run QEMU with the 'alpine-disk.qcow2' image without any additional options and without redirecting output. This will help check if it can boot in a default state. If this also fails, it may be worth considering testing with a different image or environment altogether. We will proceed with a basic execution command without any extra options.",
