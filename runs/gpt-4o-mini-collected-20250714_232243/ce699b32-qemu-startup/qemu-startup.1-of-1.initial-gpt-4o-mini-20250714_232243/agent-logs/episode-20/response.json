    "state_analysis": "The attempt to start QEMU with the QCOW2 image 'alpine-disk.qcow2' has failed due to a locking issue, indicating that another process may be using the image. This suggests that there could be a lingering QEMU process or some other process that has the image locked, preventing new instances from accessing it.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we need to check for any active QEMU processes that might be running and terminate them. Once we ensure that no other processes are using the image, we can attempt to start QEMU again. We will run a command to list all active QEMU processes and then proceed to terminate them if found.",
