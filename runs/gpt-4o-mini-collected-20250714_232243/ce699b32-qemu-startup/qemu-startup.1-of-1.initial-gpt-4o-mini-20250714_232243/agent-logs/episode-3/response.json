    "state_analysis": "The QEMU process has failed to start properly due to issues with the image format and host forwarding rule. The 'apk' package manager is not available, indicating that this environment may not be an Alpine Linux environment. Additionally, the 'netstat' command is still not found.",
    "explanation": "We need to adjust the QEMU command to use a different method to set up networking without relying on the host forwarding rule that is causing the error. We will try starting QEMU without host forwarding and check the output of QEMU to confirm it is running correctly. Then, we will check the listening ports using 'ss' instead of 'netstat' since 'netstat' is not available and 'ss' is often included by default in many environments.",
