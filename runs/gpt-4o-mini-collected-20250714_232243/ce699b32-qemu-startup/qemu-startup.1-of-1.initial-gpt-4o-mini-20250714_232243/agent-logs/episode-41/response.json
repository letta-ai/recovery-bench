    "state_analysis": "The ongoing issues with QEMU being unable to acquire write locks on the images remain unresolved, indicating that the environment is likely experiencing persistent conflicts or resource locking that cannot be managed given the current limitations.",
    "explanation": "As repeated attempts to run QEMU have not been successful, the only viable solution left is to restart the terminal session or the container to clear any potential locks on the images. If this is not possible, it would be best to switch to a different environment for running QEMU to bypass these issues altogether.",
