    "state_analysis": "The persistent inability to run QEMU with both the existing and newly created QCOW2 images suggests that there is likely a fundamental issue with either the QEMU setup or the images themselves. The failure to acquire a write lock and the message indicating another process might be using the images further complicate the situation.",
    "explanation": "Since restarting the terminal session or container is the recommended solution to clear any locks on the image files and no further troubleshooting can be performed effectively, it is essential to proceed with that option. If restarting is not feasible or does not resolve the issue, using a different environment for running QEMU should be considered as a viable alternative.",
