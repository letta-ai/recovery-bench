    "state_analysis": "The repeated failures to run QEMU with different images and configurations indicate a persistent issue with either the QEMU setup or with the image files themselves. The inability to gain a write lock suggests that some process is still holding onto the images, but we cannot identify or terminate those processes due to the lack of available commands in the environment.",
    "explanation": "Since we have exhausted attempts to run QEMU successfully and the environment is limiting our ability to troubleshoot, I recommend considering a reset of the terminal session or the environment. This should clear any locks on the image files and potentially allow QEMU to be restarted successfully. If restarting is not possible, consider running QEMU in a different environment or virtual machine setup where the dependencies and commands are available for effective management.",
