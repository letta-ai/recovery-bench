    "state_analysis": "Despite creating a new QCOW2 image and attempting to run QEMU in various configurations, the issues persist with failed write locks. This suggests that there may be remaining inconsistencies in the environment or lingering processes that are not manageable within the current setup.",
    "explanation": "Since the attempts to run QEMU have not succeeded and we cannot identify or terminate any processes using the images, the best solution is to restart the terminal session or the container. This will likely clear any locks on the images and reset the environment. If restarting is not feasible, consider using a different virtualization environment or a different host altogether to facilitate QEMU operations.",
