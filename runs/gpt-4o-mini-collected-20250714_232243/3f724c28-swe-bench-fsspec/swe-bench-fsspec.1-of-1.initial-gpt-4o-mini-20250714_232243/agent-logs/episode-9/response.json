The user has repeatedly attempted to save and exit without success, as shown by the multiple attempts to execute the same commands. This indicates that the user is stuck in the editing mode and hasn't successfully exited `vim` yet, causing the `git add` command to time out.",
    "explanation": "The user should ensure that they finish their edits and properly save and exit the `vim` editor. After successfully exiting, they will be able to run the `git add` and `git commit` commands. We will send the keystrokes to save and exit `vim` once more, then attempt the Git commands thereafter.",
