    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still in `vim`, indicated by `-- INSERT --`. The user continues to attempt to save and exit without success. The repeated commands suggest the user is stuck in the editing mode, which prevents the `git add` command from executing properly and leads to timeouts.",
    "explanation": "The user needs to ensure they finish their implementation, save the changes, and exit `vim` properly. After successfully exiting the editor, they will be able to run the `git add` and `git commit` commands. We will send the keystrokes to save and exit `vim` one more time, and then proceed with the Git commands afterward.",
