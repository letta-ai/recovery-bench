    "state_analysis": "The attempt to create the 'datasci' conda environment failed due to conflicts related to TensorFlow and NumPy versions, which prevented the installation of required packages. Additionally, the activation of the environment failed because it was not created successfully. The test script could not find the NumPy module, indicating that the environment is not set up correctly.",
    "explanation": "The next steps include modifying the environment.yml to ensure compatibility of package versions, particularly focusing on resolving the conflicts between TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, and SciPy. After modifying the file, I will recreate the environment and then run the test script again to verify if all packages are imported successfully.",
