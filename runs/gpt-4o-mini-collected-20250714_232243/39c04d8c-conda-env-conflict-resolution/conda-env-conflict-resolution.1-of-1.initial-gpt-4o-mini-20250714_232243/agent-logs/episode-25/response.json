The environment is not being removed or created successfully, which is why the test script continues to fail with a ModuleNotFoundError for NumPy and other packages.",
    "explanation": "I will manually deactivate the current environment, remove the existing 'datasci' environment completely, and then recreate it using the updated environment.yml file that includes all necessary packages including Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Once the environment is created, I will run the test script again to verify that all required packages are installed correctly and can be imported without issues.",
