This indicates that there was likely an attempt to create the environment while it already existed, which requires confirmation to overwrite it. The command to run the test script has also not been executed due to this blockage.",
    "explanation": "I will send the confirmation input to proceed with the deletion of the existing environment and the creation of a new one. After confirming, I will wait for the environment creation process to complete. Once it finishes, I will then run the test script to ensure all required packages are available and functioning correctly.",
