The repeated failures indicate that there are still unresolved package conflicts, possibly due to combinations of TensorFlow, PyTorch, and their respective dependencies, which are causing the environment resolution process to hang.",
    "explanation": "To proceed, I will simplify the environment further by removing unnecessary packages and specifying only the essential packages needed for the project. This should help avoid the conflicts that are currently preventing the environment from being created. After modifying the environment.yml file, I will attempt to create the environment again and then run the test script to verify if the imports work successfully.",
