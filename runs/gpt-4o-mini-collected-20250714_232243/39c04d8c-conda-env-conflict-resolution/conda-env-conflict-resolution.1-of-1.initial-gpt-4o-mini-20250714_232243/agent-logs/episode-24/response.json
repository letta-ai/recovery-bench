There has been a continuous loop of commands where the environment is attempting to be created, but it keeps asking for confirmation to proceed with the deletion of the existing environment without receiving a proper input. The activation command for the 'datasci' environment is not executing as expected due to this blockage.",
    "explanation": "I will proceed to send the confirmation input to delete the existing environment and allow the creation of the new one to continue. After confirming, I will wait for the environment creation to finish. Once it is complete, I will run the test script to ensure that all required packages, including Pandas, are successfully installed and can be imported without errors.",
