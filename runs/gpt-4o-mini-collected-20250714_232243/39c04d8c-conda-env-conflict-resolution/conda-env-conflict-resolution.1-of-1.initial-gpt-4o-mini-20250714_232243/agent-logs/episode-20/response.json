    "state_analysis": "The command to update the 'datasci' environment has been continuously resolving dependencies without completing. The lack of progress suggests that there may be persistent conflicts or that the necessary packages, particularly Pandas, are not being installed correctly. The attempts to import Pandas have consistently failed, confirming that it is still not part of the active environment.",
    "explanation": "To proceed, I will cancel the current update process and perform a fresh installation of the environment with a newly modified environment.yml file that includes only essential packages. This should help avoid any conflicts and ensure that all needed packages are properly installed. I will also ensure that Pandas is explicitly included in the dependencies. After creating the environment, I will run the test script again to verify all imports are successful.",
