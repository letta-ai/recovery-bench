The versioning syntax for PyTorch appears to be malformed, which prevents the environment from being created. Consequently, the environment does not exist, and the test script continues to fail with a ModuleNotFoundError for NumPy.",
    "explanation": "To fix the issue, I will correct the syntax for specifying the PyTorch package in the environment.yml file. I will ensure that the packages are specified correctly for installation. Once I have updated the file, I will recreate the environment and then run the test script to verify if the imports work successfully.",
