There have been previous failures due to unresolved package conflicts, especially with ICU and CUDA dependencies. The environment has not yet been created, which explains the repeated failures when trying to activate it and run the test script.",
    "explanation": "Since the environment creation command is still running, I will wait for it to complete. If it times out again, I will need to further simplify the dependencies or check for more specific version compatibility issues. For now, I will not issue any new commands until the current command completes.",
