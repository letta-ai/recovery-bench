The environment does not exist, and the test script fails due to the absence of the NumPy module, confirming that no valid environment was created.",
    "explanation": "To proceed, I will further refine the environment.yml file by selecting compatible versions for all packages. I will use a Python version that is known to work well with TensorFlow 2.8.2 and ensure that NumPy is compatible with both TensorFlow and SciPy. After modifying the environment.yml file, I will recreate the environment and test it again.",
