    "state_analysis": "The command to create the 'datasci' environment is still processing. It appears to be stuck on resolving the dependencies, potentially due to the presence of conflicting packages, particularly kaldi which requires CUDA that is not available on the system. The environment has not been created yet, which is why the activation and test script execution are failing.",
    "explanation": "Since the environment creation process seems to be stalled, I will stop the current command and modify the environment.yml file to further minimize the complexity of the dependencies. I will remove packages that are causing issues, such as torchaudio and any others that may not be strictly necessary for the initial environment setup. After making these adjustments, I will attempt to create the environment again.",
