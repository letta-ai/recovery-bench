    "explanation": "Since the terminal is unresponsive and I cannot execute commands to regain control, I will attempt to forcibly terminate any remaining tmux processes to regain control over the terminal. After terminating the session, I will reopen the terminal to check the status of Docker and then create a new container to test network connectivity.",
