    "state_analysis": "I am still encountering the issue of a non-responsive terminal due to the absence of an active tmux session. This situation is preventing me from executing any commands to manage Docker or exit the current shell environment. The terminal is effectively frozen, and all attempts to gain control have failed.",
    "explanation": "Given that I cannot regain control over the terminal session or execute any commands successfully, the next step is to manually close the terminal or forcefully terminate it. Once the terminal is closed and reopened, I will check the status of Docker and create a new container to test network connectivity. This will allow me to finally address the networking issues encountered within the Docker environment.",
