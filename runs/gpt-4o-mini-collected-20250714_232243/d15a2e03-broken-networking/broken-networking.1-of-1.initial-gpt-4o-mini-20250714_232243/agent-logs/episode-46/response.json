    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to indicate that there is no active tmux session, which prevents any commands from being executed. This ongoing issue is effectively locking me out of managing Docker or diagnosing network connectivity issues within the container.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot regain control over the terminal session and all previous attempts to execute commands have failed, the next step is to forcibly terminate the terminal session. After closing the terminal, I will reopen it and check the status of Docker from the host environment. Once Docker is confirmed to be running, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
