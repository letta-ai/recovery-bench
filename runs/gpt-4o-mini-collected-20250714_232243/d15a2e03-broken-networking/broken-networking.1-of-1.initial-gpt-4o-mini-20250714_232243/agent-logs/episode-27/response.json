This state prevents me from executing any commands to interact with Docker or troubleshoot the networking issues within the container. All attempts to regain control have failed, leaving the terminal effectively frozen.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent issues with the terminal session, the next step is to forcefully terminate the current session. This will allow me to reopen the terminal application and regain access to the host system. Once I have access again, I will check the Docker service status and create a new container to test network connectivity.",
