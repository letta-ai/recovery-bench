    "state_analysis": "The terminal still indicates that there is no active tmux session, preventing any commands from being executed. This situation is effectively locking me out of managing Docker or diagnosing network connectivity issues within the container, as the terminal is effectively frozen.",
    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is unresponsive and I cannot execute any commands to regain control, the next logical step is to forcibly terminate the terminal session. This will allow me to reopen the terminal application and regain access to the host environment. Once I have access again, I will check the status of Docker and create a new container to test network connectivity.",
