This persistent issue is preventing any meaningful progress on diagnosing or fixing the networking problem within the container.",
    "explanation": "As the current terminal session is essentially frozen and unresponsive to commands, I will need to forcefully terminate it. This action will allow me to escape the current state and return to a usable terminal session. After restarting the terminal application, I will check the Docker service status on the host and create a new container to test connectivity again.",
