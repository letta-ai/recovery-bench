    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is unresponsive and I cannot execute commands to regain control, I will recommend manually closing the terminal window to terminate the session. After closing the terminal, I will reopen it and check the status of Docker from the host environment. Once Docker is confirmed to be running, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
