    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still indicating that there is no active tmux session, preventing me from executing any commands or managing Docker. This situation is effectively locking me out of necessary tools to diagnose or fix the networking issues within the Docker container, resulting in an unresponsive environment.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot regain control over the terminal session and all previous attempts to exit or execute commands have failed, the next step is to forcibly terminate the current terminal session. After closing the terminal, I will reopen it and check the status of Docker from the host environment. Once Docker is confirmed to be running, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
