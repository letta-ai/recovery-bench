    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains unresponsive, indicating that there is no active tmux session. This prevents me from executing Docker commands or exiting the current interactive shell. The situation is effectively locking me out of managing Docker or diagnosing network connectivity issues within the container.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot regain control over the terminal session or execute any commands successfully, the next logical step is to forcibly terminate the terminal session. This will allow me to reopen the terminal application and regain access to the host environment. Once I have access again, I will check the status of Docker and create a new container to test network connectivity.",
