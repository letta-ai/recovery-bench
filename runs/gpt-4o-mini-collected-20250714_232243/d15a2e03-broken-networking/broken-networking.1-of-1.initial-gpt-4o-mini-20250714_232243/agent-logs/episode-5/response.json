    "state_analysis": "The commands to check network interfaces and routing have failed because the 'ip' command is not available in the Docker container. This indicates that basic networking tools are missing, which could be contributing to the inability to resolve hosts and connect to external networks.",
    "explanation": "Since we cannot use standard network diagnostic tools, I will attempt to directly modify the network settings in a more manual fashion. I will create a new network interface and set it up to use the Docker bridge interface. I'll also ensure that the correct routes are set to allow outgoing connections to the internet.",
