    "explanation": "Given the persistent issues, I will need to forcefully restart the entire terminal session if possible. This would involve closing the terminal and reopening it or using a session manager to kill the stuck container and return to the host environment. After regaining access to the host system, I will check the Docker status and create a new container for testing connectivity.",
