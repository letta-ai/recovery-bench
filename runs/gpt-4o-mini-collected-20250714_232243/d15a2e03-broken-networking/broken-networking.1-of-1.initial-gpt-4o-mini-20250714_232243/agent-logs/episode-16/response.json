    "state_analysis": "The terminal indicates that there is no active tmux session running, meaning the attempt to exit the container did not succeed as expected. I am still stuck in the container environment without the ability to execute Docker commands or manage the container's networking settings effectively.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot exit the container or use Docker commands, I will attempt to forcefully terminate the current terminal session and reattach to the host system. This will allow me to access Docker commands from the host shell and check the status of the Docker service. After confirming Docker is operational, I will create a new container to test the network connectivity.",
