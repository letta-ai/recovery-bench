    "state_analysis": "I am still encountering issues with the terminal indicating that there is no active tmux session, which prevents any commands from being executed. This situation is effectively locking me out of managing Docker or diagnosing network connectivity issues within the container.",
    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is frozen and unresponsive, the only viable option is to forcibly terminate the current terminal session. After doing so, I will reopen it and check the status of Docker from the host environment. Once I confirm that Docker is running, I will create a new container to test connectivity.",
