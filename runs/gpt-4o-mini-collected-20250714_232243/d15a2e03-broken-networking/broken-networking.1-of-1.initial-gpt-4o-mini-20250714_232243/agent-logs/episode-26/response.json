    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to indicate that there is no active tmux session, preventing any commands from being executed or any meaningful interaction with the Docker environment. This situation is effectively locking me out of managing Docker or diagnosing network connectivity issues within the container.",
    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is unresponsive, the only viable option is to forcefully terminate this session and restart the terminal application. After closing the terminal, I will reopen it and check the Docker service status from the host system. Once confirmed that Docker is running, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
