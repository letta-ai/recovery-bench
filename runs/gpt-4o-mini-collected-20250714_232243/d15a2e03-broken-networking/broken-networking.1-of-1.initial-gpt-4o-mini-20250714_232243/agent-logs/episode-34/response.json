    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still showing that there is no active tmux session, which prevents any commands from being executed. This ongoing issue is causing a blockage in accessing Docker commands or exiting the current shell, resulting in an unresponsive state.",
    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is frozen and unresponsive, the next step is to forcibly terminate the current session. After closing the terminal, I will reopen it and check the status of Docker to ensure it is running. Once Docker is operational, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
