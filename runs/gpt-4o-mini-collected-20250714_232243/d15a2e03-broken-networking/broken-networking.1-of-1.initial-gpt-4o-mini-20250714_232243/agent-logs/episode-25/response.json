    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive with no active tmux session running, preventing any commands from being executed, including Docker commands or exiting the current shell. This ongoing issue has made it impossible to troubleshoot the networking problems within the Docker container.",
    "explanation": "Since the terminal is not responsive and I cannot exit or execute any commands, the next logical step is to forcibly terminate the terminal session. This will allow me to reopen the terminal and regain access to the host environment. Once I have access, I will check the status of Docker and create a new container to verify network connectivity.",
