    "state_analysis": "I am still in a non-responsive terminal state due to the absence of an active tmux session. This prevents me from executing any commands to manage Docker or exit the container properly. The terminal is stuck, and all attempts to gain control or check the status of Docker have failed.",
    "explanation": "As I cannot recover the terminal session through commands, the only viable option is to forcibly terminate the terminal window or session. After doing so, I will reopen the terminal, check the status of Docker, and then create a new container to test network connectivity once Docker is confirmed to be running.",
