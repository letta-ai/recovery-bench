This ongoing issue has rendered the terminal effectively frozen, blocking any further interaction with Docker or network troubleshooting.",
    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is unresponsive and I cannot regain control, the next logical step is to forcibly terminate the terminal session. This will allow me to reopen the terminal application and regain access to the host environment. Once I have access again, I will check the status of Docker and create a new container to test network connectivity.",
