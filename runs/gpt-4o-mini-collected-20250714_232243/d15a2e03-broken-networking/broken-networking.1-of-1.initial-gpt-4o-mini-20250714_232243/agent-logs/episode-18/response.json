    "explanation": "Since it seems impossible to regain control over the current terminal session, I will recommend forcefully terminating this session (if possible) and restarting the terminal application. This will allow me to return to the host environment where I can manage Docker. After restarting, I will check the status of Docker and create a new container to test connectivity.",
