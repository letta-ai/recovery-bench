Use tmux keystrokes like `C-x` or `Escape` to interactively navigate the terminal. If you would like to execute a command that you have written you will need to append a newline character to the end of your command.\n\nFor example, if you write \"ls -la\" you will need to append a newline character to the end of your command like this: `ls -la\\n`.\n\nOne thing to be very careful about is handling interactive sessions like less, vim, or git diff. In these cases, you should not wait for the output of the command. Instead, you should send the keystrokes to the terminal as if you were typing them.\n\nThe current terminal state is:\nroot@334eb1141252:/app#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
