The container appears to be unable to connect to external networks, and the basic networking commands are also unavailable. This suggests a misconfiguration in the container's network settings.",
    "explanation": "I will attempt to change the network settings directly within the container by resetting the network interface and adding a new default route. However, since I cannot use the 'ip' command, I will try using 'route' instead, as it might still be available. After that, I will check the connectivity again with curl.",
