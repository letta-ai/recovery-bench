This situation prevents any commands from being executed, including Docker commands or exiting the current shell. The terminal is effectively frozen, and all attempts to regain control have failed.",
    "explanation": "Given that I cannot recover the terminal session through commands, the only viable option is to forcibly terminate the current terminal session. This action will allow me to escape the current state and return to the host environment. After regaining access, I will check the status of Docker and create a new container to test network connectivity again.",
