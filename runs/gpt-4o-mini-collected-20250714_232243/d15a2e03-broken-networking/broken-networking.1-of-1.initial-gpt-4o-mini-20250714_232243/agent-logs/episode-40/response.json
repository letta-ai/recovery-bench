    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to report that there is no active tmux session, which prevents any commands from being executed successfully. This ongoing issue is effectively locking me out of managing Docker or troubleshooting the network issues within the container.",
    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is frozen and unresponsive, the next step is to forcefully terminate the terminal session. After closing the terminal, I will reopen it and check the status of Docker from the host environment. Once Docker is confirmed to be operational, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
