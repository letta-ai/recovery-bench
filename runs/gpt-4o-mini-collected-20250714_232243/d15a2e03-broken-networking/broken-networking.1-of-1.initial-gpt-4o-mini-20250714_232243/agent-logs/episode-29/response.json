This persistent issue is effectively locking me out of managing Docker or diagnosing network connectivity issues within the container.",
    "explanation": "As the current terminal session is frozen and unresponsive to commands, the best course of action is to forcibly terminate the terminal window or session. After doing so, I will reopen the terminal and check the status of Docker from the host environment. Once Docker is confirmed to be running, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
