This situation is causing a blockage in accessing Docker commands or exiting the current shell, resulting in an unresponsive state.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot regain control over the terminal session or execute any commands successfully, the next logical step is to forcibly terminate the terminal session. This will allow me to reopen the terminal application and regain access to the host environment. Once I have access again, I will check the status of Docker and create a new container to test network connectivity.",
