The persistent networking issues remain unresolved, as evidenced by the failure to connect to external services like example.com.",
    "explanation": "Given that I cannot access Docker commands or check the service status from within the container, I will suggest exiting the container and returning to the host system shell. From there, I can check the status of Docker and ensure it is running properly. After confirming that Docker is operational, I can create a new container to test the network connectivity again.",
