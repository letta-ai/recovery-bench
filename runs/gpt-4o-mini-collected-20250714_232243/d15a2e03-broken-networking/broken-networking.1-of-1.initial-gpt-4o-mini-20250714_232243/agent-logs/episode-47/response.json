This situation prevents any commands from being executed, including Docker commands or exiting the current shell. The terminal is effectively frozen, and all attempts to regain control have failed.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent issues with the terminal session being unresponsive, the next step is to forcibly terminate the current terminal session. After doing so, I will reopen the terminal and check the status of Docker from the host environment. Once Docker is confirmed to be running, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
