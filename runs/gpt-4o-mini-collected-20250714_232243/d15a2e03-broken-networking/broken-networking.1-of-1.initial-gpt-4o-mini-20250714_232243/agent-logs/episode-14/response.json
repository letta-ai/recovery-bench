    "state_analysis": "The previous commands related to Docker are not recognized, indicating that the Docker service is likely not running or not accessible from the current shell environment. Therefore, I cannot manage Docker containers or check their statuses. The networking issues within the container persist, and the attempts to resolve them have all failed due to missing utilities and commands.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot control Docker from this shell and the networking issue remains unresolved, I will suggest checking the Docker status from the host system directly, if possible. If Docker is not running, it may need to be started from the host. After ensuring Docker is operational, I would then create a new container to check connectivity again.",
