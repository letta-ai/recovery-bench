    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is unresponsive and I cannot execute any commands to regain control, the next step is to forcefully terminate the terminal session and restart the terminal application. After closing the terminal, I will reopen it and check the status of Docker from the host environment. Once Docker is confirmed to be running, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
