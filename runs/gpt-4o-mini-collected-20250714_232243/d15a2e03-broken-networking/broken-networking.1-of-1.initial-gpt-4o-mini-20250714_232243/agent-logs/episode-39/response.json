    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to indicate that there is no active tmux session, preventing any commands from being executed. This situation is locking me out of managing Docker or diagnosing network connectivity issues within the container, resulting in an unresponsive state.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot regain control over the terminal session and all previous attempts to exit or execute commands have failed, the next step is to forcibly terminate the current terminal session. After doing so, I will reopen the terminal and check the status of Docker from the host environment. Once Docker is operational, I will create a new container to test network connectivity.",
