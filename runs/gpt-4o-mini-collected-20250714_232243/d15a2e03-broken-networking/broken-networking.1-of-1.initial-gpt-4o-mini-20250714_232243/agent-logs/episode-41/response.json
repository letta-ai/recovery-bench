    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still showing that there is no active tmux session, meaning I cannot execute any commands or manage Docker effectively. This results in an unresponsive environment and prevents any troubleshooting of the networking issues within the Docker container.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot regain control over the terminal session and all previous attempts to execute commands have failed, the next course of action is to forcibly terminate the terminal session. After doing so, I will reopen the terminal application to access the host environment. Once I regain access, I will check the status of Docker and create a new container to test network connectivity.",
