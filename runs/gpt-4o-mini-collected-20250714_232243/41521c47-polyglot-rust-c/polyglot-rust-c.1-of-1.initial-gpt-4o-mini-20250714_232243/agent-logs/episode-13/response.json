    "state_analysis": "The code structure in main.rs has not been successfully resolved. The C++ and Rust portions are still mixed incorrectly, causing syntax and linkage issues. The C++ main function should not be mixed with the Rust definition of the Fibonacci function, as they need to be distinct and properly interfaced.",
    "explanation": "I will now properly separate the C++ and Rust sections while ensuring that they can communicate. The C++ part will call the Rust Fibonacci function correctly, and the Rust section will not include another main function. Let's fix this once and for all and ensure the file is correctly structured before compiling.",
