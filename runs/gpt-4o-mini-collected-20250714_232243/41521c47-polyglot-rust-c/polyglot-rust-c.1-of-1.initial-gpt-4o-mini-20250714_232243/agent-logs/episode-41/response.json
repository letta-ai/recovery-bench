This will lead to compilation errors as the same function cannot be defined multiple times in a single file, and there are still two main functions, which are invalid for both languages.",
    "explanation": "I will now execute a final rewrite of the main.rs file to ensure that it contains a valid structure for both C++ and Rust. The C++ function will call the Rust implementation of Fibonacci correctly, and I will ensure that there are no duplicate definitions. This is the last attempt to ensure that the implementation works correctly. Let's perform this rewrite now.",
