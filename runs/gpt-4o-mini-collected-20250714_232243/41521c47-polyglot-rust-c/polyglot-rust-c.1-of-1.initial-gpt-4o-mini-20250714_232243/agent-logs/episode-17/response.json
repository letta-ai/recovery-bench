    "state_analysis": "The structure of the code in main.rs remains flawed, with C++ and Rust definitions improperly mixed. The C++ section is attempting to call a Rust function defined incorrectly, leading to compilation errors. There are multiple main functions, which is invalid.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, I will rewrite the main.rs file to ensure the C++ and Rust code are correctly structured and the functions can properly interface with each other. I will define a single main function for C++ and ensure the Rust function can be called directly. Let's rewrite the code accurately now.",
