    "state_analysis": "The code in main.rs has been duplicated with issues persisting across both C++ and Rust sections. The C++ main function is not correctly linked to the Rust Fibonacci function, and there is still a repeated definition of the Fibonacci function in both languages, which is not valid.",
    "explanation": "Let\u2019s finalize the separation of the two language implementations. The C++ part will only call the Rust function, and the Rust function will be defined once and accessed correctly. I will correct the structure to ensure it is valid for both languages and maintain the polyglot aspect. Let's rewrite the file properly now.",
