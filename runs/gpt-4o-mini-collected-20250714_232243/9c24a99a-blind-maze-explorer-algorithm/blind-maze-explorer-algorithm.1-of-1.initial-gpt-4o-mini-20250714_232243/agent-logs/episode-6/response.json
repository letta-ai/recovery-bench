    "state_analysis": "We have successfully moved East multiple times, but the last command indicates that we are still hitting walls when trying to move South and West. This suggests that we are likely in a narrow corridor with walls blocking adjacent paths. We need to explore alternative routes or backtrack to find new paths.",
    "explanation": "Since we have reached a position where moving East has not revealed further options, we will attempt to backtrack to the previous position where we had options. We will first move West to return to the last explored position, then start checking movements from there again. This will help us explore other potential paths in the maze.",
