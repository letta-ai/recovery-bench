    "state_analysis": "The 'ars.R' script has been updated with additional debugging outputs, but it still fails to generate the expected sample files 'normal_samples.txt' and 'exponential_samples.txt'. Despite multiple checks indicating that the R environment is capable of writing files, the adaptive rejection sampler script appears to be malfunctioning without producing errors or output during execution.",
    "explanation": "To further diagnose the issue, I will simplify the 'ars.R' script to its most basic form, focusing solely on generating the sample files without any additional logic. I will also run it directly from the R interactive session to see if any errors or messages are displayed during its execution.",
