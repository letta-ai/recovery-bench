The lack of error messages during execution suggests that the script may not be executing fully, or there is another underlying issue preventing file writing.",
    "explanation": "I will now simplify the R script to its most basic form to test if even the simplest write functionality works. This will help determine if the issue lies with the original script logic or if it's a broader issue with the R environment. I will create a new script with just the file writing commands and execute it.",
