You will be given a task instruction and the output from previously executed commands. Your goal is to solve the task by providing batches of shell commands.\n\nFor each response:\n1. Analyze the current state based on any terminal output provided\n2. Determine the next set of commands needed to make progress\n3. Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding\n\nInstruction:\nSet up an Nginx web server with advanced request logging and custom configurations. Your task is to:\n\n1. Install Nginx web server\n2. Configure the server to:\n   - Listen on port 8080\n   - Serve static files from /var/www/html\n   - Implement detailed request logging that logs timestamps ($time_local), request methods ($request_method), response status codes ($status), and user agents ($http_user_agent, double-quote the user agent in logs), save to `/var/log/nginx/benchmark-access.log`\n   - Set up rate limiting to allow only 10 requests per second per IP address\n   Place the configuration in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/benchmark-site.conf`.\n3. Create a simple index.html file in the document root with the content:\n   \"Welcome to the benchmark webserver\"\n4. Create a custom 404.html page with the content:\n   \"Page not found - Please check your URL\"\n5. Start the Nginx server and ensure it's running properly\n\nThe solution should minimize the number of commands while ensuring all requirements are met. The web server should be accessible on localhost:8080 after the setup is complete.\n\nYour response must be a JSON object that matches this schema:\n\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"Command\": {\n      \"additionalProperties\": false,\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"keystrokes\": {\n          \"description\": \"Keystrokes to execute in the terminal.

Use tmux keystrokes like `C-x` or `Escape` to interactively navigate the terminal.

In these cases, you should not wait for the output of the command. Instead, you should send the keystrokes to the terminal as if you were typing them.\n\nThe current terminal state is:\nroot@457f1ab9a4c6:/app#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
