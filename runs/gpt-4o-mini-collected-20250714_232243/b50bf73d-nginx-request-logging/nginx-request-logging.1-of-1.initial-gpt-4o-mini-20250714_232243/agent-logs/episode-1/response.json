    "state_analysis": "The terminal has encountered issues with starting Nginx due to a policy-rc.d restriction. This means that the service cannot be started in the way attempted. The configuration file and HTML files have been created successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since the previous attempt to start Nginx did not succeed due to system restrictions, I will try starting Nginx again using a different approach that bypasses the systemd service manager. I will directly run the Nginx command to start it in the foreground, which should allow us to see any errors if they occur.",
