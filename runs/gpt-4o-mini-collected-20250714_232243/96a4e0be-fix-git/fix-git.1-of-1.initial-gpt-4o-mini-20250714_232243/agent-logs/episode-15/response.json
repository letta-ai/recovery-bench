    "explanation": "Since previous attempts to terminate the pager or exit it have not worked, we will attempt to forcibly close the terminal application itself. This should allow us to restart the terminal and regain control to execute the necessary git commands. After restarting the terminal, we can check the branches and merge changes into `master`.",
