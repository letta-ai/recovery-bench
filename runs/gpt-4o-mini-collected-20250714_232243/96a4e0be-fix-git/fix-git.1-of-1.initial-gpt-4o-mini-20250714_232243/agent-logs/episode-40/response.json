    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to be unresponsive, stuck in the pager interface displaying help information. Previous commands to exit the pager have failed, indicating a persistent issue with terminal interaction.",
    "explanation": "Since we have exhausted all normal methods to escape from the pager and the terminal remains unresponsive, we will need to forcefully terminate the terminal session. This will allow us to restart the terminal and regain control to execute the necessary git commands. After restarting, we can check the branches and merge changes into `master`. We will proceed with a forced termination of the pager process using `kill` commands.",
