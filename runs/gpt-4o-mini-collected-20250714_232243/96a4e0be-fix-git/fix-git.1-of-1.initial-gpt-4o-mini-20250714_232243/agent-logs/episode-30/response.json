    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains stuck in the pager interface, displaying help information without allowing any exit commands to work. This indicates a persistent issue with being unable to interact normally with the terminal.",
    "explanation": "Since we have exhausted all normal methods to escape from the pager, we will need to terminate the terminal session entirely and restart it. This will allow us to regain control and execute the necessary git commands. After restarting the terminal, we can check the branches and merge changes into `master`. We will proceed with a forced exit from the terminal session using `kill` commands.",
