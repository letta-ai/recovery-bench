    "explanation": "Since previous attempts to exit the pager have failed, we will take the step of forcefully terminating the terminal session. This will allow us to restart the terminal and regain control to execute the necessary git commands. After restarting, we can check the branches and merge changes into `master`. We will proceed with a forced termination of the pager process.",
