    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to be stuck in the pager interface, displaying help information and failing to respond to exit commands. This indicates a persistent issue with the pager.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to exit the pager have failed, we will now take the step of forcefully terminating the terminal session. This will allow us to restart the terminal and regain control. After restarting, we will execute the necessary git commands to check branches and merge changes into `master`. We will proceed with a forced termination of the pager process using the appropriate command.",
