    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still stuck in the pager interface, continuously displaying help information. Attempts to exit the pager have repeatedly failed, indicating a persistent state of unresponsiveness.",
    "explanation": "Since we cannot exit the pager normally and the terminal remains unresponsive, we will need to forcefully terminate the terminal session to regain control. This will allow us to restart the session and execute the necessary git commands to check branches and merge changes into `master`. We will proceed with a forced termination of the pager process.",
