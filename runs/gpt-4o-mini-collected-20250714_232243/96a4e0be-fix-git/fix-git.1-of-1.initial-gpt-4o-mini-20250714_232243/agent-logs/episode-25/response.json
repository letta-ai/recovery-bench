    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains stuck in the pager, continuously displaying help information. Attempts to exit or interrupt the pager have been ineffective, indicating a persistent issue with unresponsiveness.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous commands to exit the pager have failed, we will now take the step to forcibly terminate the terminal session. This should allow us to restart the terminal and regain control. Once we restart, we can execute the necessary git commands to check branches and merge changes into `master`. We will proceed with a forced termination of the pager process.",
