    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still stuck in the pager interface, continuously displaying help information without allowing us to exit. Previous attempts to break out of the pager have not been successful.",
    "explanation": "Since we are unable to exit the pager and the terminal remains unresponsive, we will attempt to use `Ctrl+D` to signal an end of input, which can sometimes help break out of a stuck process. If that fails, we will need to forcibly terminate the terminal session altogether. After regaining control, we can proceed to execute the necessary git commands to check branches and merge changes into `master`.",
