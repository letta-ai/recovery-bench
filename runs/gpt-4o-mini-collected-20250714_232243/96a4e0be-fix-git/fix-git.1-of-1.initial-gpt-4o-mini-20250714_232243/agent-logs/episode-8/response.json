    "explanation": "Since we've exhausted the standard exit commands and the terminal is still not responsive, we will use a forced exit by terminating the terminal session. This will require manually closing the terminal window or using a command that can force the session to end, if available. After restarting the terminal, we can check the branches and merge changes into `master`.",
