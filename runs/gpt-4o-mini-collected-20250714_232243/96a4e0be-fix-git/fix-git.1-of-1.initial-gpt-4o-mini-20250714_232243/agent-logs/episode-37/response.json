    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains stuck in the pager interface, continuously displaying help information without allowing any exit commands to work. This indicates a persistent issue with being unable to interact normally with the terminal.",
    "explanation": "Since we cannot exit the pager and the terminal is unresponsive, we will proceed with a forced termination of the terminal session. This will allow us to restart the terminal and regain control to execute the necessary git commands. After restarting, we can check the branches and merge changes into `master`. We will take the necessary steps to forcefully terminate the pager process.",
