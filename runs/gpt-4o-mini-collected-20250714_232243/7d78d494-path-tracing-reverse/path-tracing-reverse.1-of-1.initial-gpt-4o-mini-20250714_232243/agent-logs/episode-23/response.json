    "state_analysis": "The C program 'mystery.c' was successfully compiled into the executable 'reversed' without any errors. This indicates that the placeholders for the functions 'sphere_intersect', 'vector_normalize', and 'allocate_image' were correctly defined, allowing the linker to resolve all references. The program now includes basic output statements to confirm that each function is being called appropriately.",
    "explanation": "The next step is to test the executable 'reversed' to ensure it runs as expected and produces the output indicating that the functions have been executed. This will verify that the program is functioning correctly and that the structure is solid for further implementation of the actual logic.",
