    "state_analysis": "The assembly output continues to show a series of floating-point operations, comparisons, and conditionals. The presence of functions like `cvtss2sd` indicates that the program is converting single-precision floats to double-precision. The code also contains checks and logical operations, suggesting that it is performing complex mathematical computations, likely involving geometric shapes or physics simulations. The iterative structure, with jumps and conditionals, indicates a loop that processes data multiple times.",
    "explanation": "To fully capture the operations and logic of the main function, I will extract more lines from the assembly output. This will provide the final details needed to accurately implement the equivalent functionality in C code.",
