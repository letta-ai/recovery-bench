    "state_analysis": "The output continues to show intricate floating-point operations, including additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions, as well as square root calculations. The usage of SSE instructions indicates that the program is heavily utilizing vectorized operations for performance. The results of these calculations are being stored in various locations on the stack, suggesting a complex algorithm likely related to mathematical or graphical processing. This reinforces the idea that the original program is performing some form of numerical computation, possibly related to vectors or images.",
    "explanation": "To fully understand the operations taking place in the main function, I will extract more lines from the assembly output. This will help complete the context needed to accurately implement the equivalent functionality in C code.",
