Write a C program called mystery.c that performs an identical operation.\nYou can do this by observing input output behavior, decompiling the program, or anything else.\nThe effect of running ./mystery should be identical to running gcc -o reversed mystery.c -lm && ./reversed\nshould be completely identical.\nYour c program must be <10k when compressed.\nYou must not invoke ./mystery. Your C program must be fully independent and work even if I run it in complete isolation.",
