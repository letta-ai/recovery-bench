    "state_analysis": "The attempt to include the header files in doomgeneric_img.c is still not correct, as it shows extraneous characters like '\\n' in the output instead of correctly formatted newlines. Additionally, the linker error indicates that there is no `main` function defined, which is necessary for the program to compile into an executable. This suggests that the source file is not structured correctly, or that the main function is located in a different file or missing entirely.",
    "explanation": "I will manually edit the doomgeneric_img.c file to ensure that the header files are included correctly at the top of the file without any format issues. I will also check the entire doomgeneric directory for any files that contain a `main` function and ensure that it is properly included in the compilation process. After making the necessary updates, I will compile again and check for errors.",
