    "state_analysis": "The previous attempts to compile doomgeneric_img.c have failed due to incorrect formatting of the include directives and a missing `main` function. The use of `vim` is not available, which limits my ability to manually edit the file directly within the container. The linker error indicates that the executable cannot be created because the `main` function is undefined.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, I will create a new temporary file to correctly define the contents of doomgeneric_img.c, ensuring that the header files are included properly. I will also include a `main` function that calls the necessary initialization functions from doomgeneric_img.c. After creating this new file, I will compile it and check for any issues.",
