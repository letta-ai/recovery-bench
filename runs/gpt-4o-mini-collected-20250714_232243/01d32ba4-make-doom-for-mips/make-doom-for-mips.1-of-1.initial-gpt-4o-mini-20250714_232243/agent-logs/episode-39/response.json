The executable doomgeneric_mips is still not found, indicating that the compilation process has not succeeded in creating it.

    "explanation": "Given that previous attempts to exit and reset the environment have failed, the next step is to forcefully terminate the terminal session. After exiting, I will restart a new terminal session to initiate a fresh environment. Once I have access to a new terminal, I will set up the Docker container again and attempt the compilation process from the beginning.",
