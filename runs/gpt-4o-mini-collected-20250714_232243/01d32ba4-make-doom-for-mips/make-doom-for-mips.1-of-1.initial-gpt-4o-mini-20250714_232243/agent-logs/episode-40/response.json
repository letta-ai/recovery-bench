The doomgeneric_mips executable has not been created despite repeated compilation attempts, and the environment appears to be locked, preventing any further actions.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent issues with the Docker container and the terminal, the best course of action is to forcefully terminate the terminal session and start a new one. This will clear out any stuck processes and allow for a fresh environment. After starting a new terminal, I will set up the Docker container and attempt the compilation process from scratch.",
