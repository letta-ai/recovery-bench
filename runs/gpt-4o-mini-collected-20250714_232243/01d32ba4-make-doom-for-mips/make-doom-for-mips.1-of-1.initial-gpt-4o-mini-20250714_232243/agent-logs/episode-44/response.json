    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive and unable to execute commands, including Docker management commands. The issues with the doomgeneric_mips executable remain unresolved, and the environment appears to be stuck in a state that prevents any further actions. The compilation process has not successfully produced the executable, and attempts to manage the Docker container have consistently timed out.",
    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is unresponsive, I will need to forcefully close the terminal application and restart it. After launching a new terminal session, I will re-establish the Docker container setup and attempt the compilation process once more in a fresh environment. This is necessary to clear any state issues that have been affecting the operations.",
