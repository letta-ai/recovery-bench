    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to be unresponsive, and attempts to manage Docker containers and compile the code have systematically failed. The doomgeneric_mips executable remains elusive, and the terminal environment is effectively locked, preventing further commands from being executed. The commands to handle Docker processes have not succeeded, leading to a prolonged state of inactivity.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent issues with the Docker container and the unresponsiveness of the terminal, the next step must be to forcibly terminate the terminal session and restart it entirely. This will allow for a clean start, where I can create a new Docker container and begin the compilation process again without the previous environment affecting it. I will attempt to exit the terminal session forcefully and then re-establish the connection.",
