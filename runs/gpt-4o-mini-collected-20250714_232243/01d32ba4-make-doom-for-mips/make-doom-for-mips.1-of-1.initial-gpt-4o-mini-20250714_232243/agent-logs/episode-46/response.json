The doomgeneric_mips executable is still not found, indicating that the compilation has not been successful despite the code being compiled multiple times. The environment is in a state where normal operations cannot continue due to repeated failures in command execution.",
    "explanation": "Given the ongoing issues with the terminal and Docker commands, I will now attempt to forcibly terminate the entire terminal session from the host system. This will help reset the environment. After doing so, I will start a new terminal session, create a fresh Docker container, and retry the compilation process from scratch. This approach should help clear any lingering problems in the current setup.",
