    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and all attempts to manage the Docker container have failed. The execution of node vm.js continues to throw an error indicating that the doomgeneric_mips executable is not found. This suggests that despite the compilation attempts, the executable is either not being created or is being deleted or lost due to some issue in the environment.",
    "explanation": "Since the terminal session is unresponsive and commands are timing out, I will attempt to forcibly exit this session and start a completely new one. After that, I will recreate the Docker container and attempt to perform the compilation steps from the beginning in a fresh environment. This should help eliminate any residual issues from the current state.",
