    "state_analysis": "The compilation of doomgeneric_img.c failed because it cannot find 'my_stdlib.h', which is likely a dependency required by the source file. As a result, the doomgeneric_mips file was not created. The previous attempt to run node vm.js also failed because the executable file does not exist. We need to locate the missing header file and ensure it is included in the compilation process.",
