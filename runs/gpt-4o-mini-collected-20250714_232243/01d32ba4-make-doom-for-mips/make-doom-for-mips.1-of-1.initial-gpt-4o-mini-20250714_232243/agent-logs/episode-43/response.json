    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains unresponsive, and attempts to manage Docker containers, including killing the active containers, have failed. The issues with the doomgeneric_mips executable persist, and the environment is in a critical state that prevents normal command execution. The inability to exit the terminal or manage the Docker service indicates a deeper issue with the environment.",
    "explanation": "Since the current terminal session is completely unresponsive and cannot execute commands, I will now attempt to close the terminal session from the host system or restart the terminal application. This should clear any stuck states and allow me to start fresh. Once I have access to a new terminal session, I will begin by creating a new Docker container and following through with the compilation steps again.",
