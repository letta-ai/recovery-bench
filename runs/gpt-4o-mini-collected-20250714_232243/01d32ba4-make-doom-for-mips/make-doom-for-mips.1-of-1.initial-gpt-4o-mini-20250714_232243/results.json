    "instruction": "I have provided /app/doomgeneric/, the source code to doom. I've also wrote a special doomgeneric_img.c that I want you to use which will write each drawn frame to /tmp/frame.bmp. I've finally provided vm.js that will expect a file called doomgeneric_mips and will run it. Please figure out the rest and build the doomgeneric_mips ELF for me, so that I can run `node vm.js`. After running `node vm.js` I expect that stdout will be printed appropriately, and frames will be written to the file system.",
