    "explanation": "Since all commands have failed, including attempts to navigate and return, I will attempt to issue a command that corresponds to a simple action that might be recognized. I will try 'climb down' again but will use a different phrasing: 'descend into canyon' to see if this phrasing can be recognized by the game.",
