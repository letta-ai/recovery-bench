The task of logging the model is complete, but the warnings suggest that further action should be taken to resolve this issue for future logging.",
    "explanation": "To address the Git executable warning, we can check if Git is installed and available in the system's PATH. If Git is installed but not found, we can manually specify its path. Additionally, we can silence the warning messages by setting the GIT_PYTHON_REFRESH environment variable to 'quiet'. However, since the primary task of logging the model is complete, further attempts may not be necessary unless we want to refine the process.",
