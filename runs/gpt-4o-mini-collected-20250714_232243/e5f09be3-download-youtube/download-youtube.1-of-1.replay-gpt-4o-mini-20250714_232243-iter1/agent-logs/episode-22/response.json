Consequently, the command to run it was not found. The file 'me_at_the_zoo.mp4' remains invalid, lacking the necessary video data as confirmed by ffmpeg.",
    "explanation": "Since installing an alternative downloader via the package manager has failed, we will explore using a different method to download the video. We will try using a Python script that utilizes 'yt-dlp' to download the video without relying on the command line directly. This approach often circumvents issues with command line restrictions.",
