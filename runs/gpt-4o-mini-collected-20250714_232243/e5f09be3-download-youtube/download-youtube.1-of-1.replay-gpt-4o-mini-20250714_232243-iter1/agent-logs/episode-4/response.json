The warnings indicate issues with extracting the video formats, and the subsequent attempt to process it with ffmpeg failed again due to invalid data.",
    "explanation": "The next step is to ensure a proper download by using a different method or checking for any issues with yt-dlp. We will try to force a re-download of the video and ensure it is the correct format. If that fails, we can explore alternatives for downloading the video.",
