    "state_analysis": "The terminal output indicates that the download process using 'yt-dlp' has resulted in an error, showing that the file 'me_at_the_zoo.mp4' is still invalid, as it contains no actual video data (0.00B). Attempts to decode the file with ffmpeg have failed due to a missing moov atom, which is crucial for video playback.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to download the video have failed with invalid results, it is necessary to switch to a different approach. We will try using an alternative video downloader that might handle YouTube's restrictions more effectively. We can also try using a different known valid URL method to download the video directly.",
