    "state_analysis": "The terminal output shows that attempts to download the video using 'yt-dlp' continue to fail with a precondition check error from YouTube. The downloaded file seems to be invalid, as indicated by ffmpeg's inability to process it due to missing data (moov atom). This persistent issue suggests that the video cannot be downloaded successfully through the current methods.",
    "explanation": "The next approach will be to clear any previously downloaded files and use a different method to download the video. Instead of relying on 'yt-dlp', we can try using a different tool or approach to directly access the video file from YouTube. This may involve identifying the direct video stream URL or using an alternative downloader.",
