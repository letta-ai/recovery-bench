    "state_analysis": "The required dependencies for fasttext are all installed: numpy (version not shown), pybind11 (version 3.0.0), and setuptools (version 80.9.0). However, the version of numpy was not printed, which might indicate an issue with its installation. Additionally, the version of setuptools is quite old and could potentially cause compatibility issues with other packages.",
