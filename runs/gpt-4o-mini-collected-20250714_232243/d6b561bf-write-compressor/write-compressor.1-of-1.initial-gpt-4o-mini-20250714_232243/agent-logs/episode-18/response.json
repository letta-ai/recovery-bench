    "state_analysis": "The contents of 'data.txt' have been displayed, showing a significant amount of text related to data compression concepts. This content is suitable for testing the decompressor, as it contains repetitive phrases and structure that could be effectively compressed and decompressed.",
    "explanation": "Since the decompressor successfully processed the minimal test case ('test_data.txt') without crashing, it indicates that the issue likely arose from the original 'data.txt' content or its interaction with the decompressor. I will attempt to compress 'data.txt' again with the decompressor to see if the issue can be replicated and to assess the output quality.",
