    "state_analysis": "The core dump file is present and quite large (7.2M), indicating that the program produced a significant amount of data before crashing. However, I do not have access to the `file` command or a debugging tool to analyze the core dump directly.",
    "explanation": "To further investigate the cause of the stack smashing error, I will attempt to use `gdb` to debug the core file if it were available. However, since it is not installed, I will create a new basic test case, slightly different from previous attempts, and see if the decompressor can handle this without crashing. I will create a file with a known pattern that should be straightforward for the decompressor to process.",
