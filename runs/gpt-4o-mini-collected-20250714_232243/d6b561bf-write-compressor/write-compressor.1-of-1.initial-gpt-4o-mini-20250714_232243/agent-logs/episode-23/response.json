    "state_analysis": "The decompressor has failed to process the new test case ('pattern_test.txt') as well, resulting in an empty 'pattern_test.comp' file. This indicates that the stack smashing issue is persistent and is likely due to a fundamental flaw in the decompressor's logic or memory handling, rather than the input data itself.",
    "explanation": "Given that all attempts to compress various inputs have failed, I will take a step back and review the main areas of the decompressor code for potential flaws, specifically focusing on memory allocation and recursive function calls. I will also consider commenting out sections of the code to narrow down the source of the issue. However, without debugging tools available, I will need to rely on code review and manual testing.",
