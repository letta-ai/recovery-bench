    "state_analysis": "The decompressor continues to experience stack smashing errors even with a smaller subset of data from 'small_data.txt'. This indicates that the issue is not solely related to the size or complexity of the input data but may be inherent to the decompressor's logic or handling of data.",
    "explanation": "Since attempts to compress even the simplest versions of the data have failed, I will further simplify the input by manually creating a very basic string to test the decompressor. This will help isolate whether the problem lies within specific data patterns or the decompressor itself.",
