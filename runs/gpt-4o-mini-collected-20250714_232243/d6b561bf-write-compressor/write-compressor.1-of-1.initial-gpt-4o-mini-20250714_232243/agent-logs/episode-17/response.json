    "state_analysis": "The attempt to create a minimal test case was successful, as the decompressor was able to process 'test_data.txt' without crashing, resulting in a non-empty 'test_data.comp' file. This suggests that the original data or the way it was processed may have been causing the stack smashing error.",
    "explanation": "I will further inspect the contents of 'test_data.comp' to verify that the decompressed output matches the input. This will help confirm that the decompressor works correctly for valid inputs. Additionally, I will check the contents of 'data.txt' to ensure its format is suitable for the decompressor without causing errors.",
