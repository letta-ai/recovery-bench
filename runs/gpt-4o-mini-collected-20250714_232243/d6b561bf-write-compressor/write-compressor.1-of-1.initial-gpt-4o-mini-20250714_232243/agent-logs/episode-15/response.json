    "state_analysis": "The stack smashing error persists despite attempts to modify the `gc()` function and initialize `fraction`. This suggests that the changes made were insufficient or that other parts of the code are contributing to the problem. The continuing core dump indicates a severe issue with memory access or management during execution.",
    "explanation": "I will now consider printing out debug information to isolate where the failure occurs. Since gdb is not available, I will add print statements in the code to track the values of critical variables (like `range`, `fraction`, and the return values of `get_bit()`) and ensure they are within expected limits. After adding these debug statements, I will recompile and run the program again.",
