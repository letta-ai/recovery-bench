    "state_analysis": "The stack smashing error still occurs and gdb is not available for debugging. The displayed code snippet shows more of the decompressor's logic, but the root cause of the stack smashing issue is still unclear. The recursive nature of `get_bit()` and the handling of the fraction may lead to issues if `gc()` is not properly defined or is producing unexpected results.",
    "explanation": "Since gdb is unavailable, I will print the entire `get_bit()` function to review its logic more closely and look for potential issues that could lead to stack smashing. It's essential to ensure that the function is implemented correctly and that its dependencies are handled appropriately.",
