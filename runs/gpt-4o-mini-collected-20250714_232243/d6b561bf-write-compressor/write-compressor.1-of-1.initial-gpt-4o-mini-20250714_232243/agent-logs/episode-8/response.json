    "state_analysis": "The missing definitions for `OFF1`, `OFF2`, and `LITSIZE` have been located in decomp.c. Their values are as follows: OFF1 = 5, OFF2 = 2, LITSIZE = 4. The `get_bit()` function is also defined, which is crucial for understanding the decompressor's logic.",
    "explanation": "With the necessary definitions and context now available, I will analyze the `get_bit()` function to ensure it is implemented correctly and does not cause stack smashing. After understanding the complete logic, I can make adjustments if needed, recompile the code, and test it again.",
