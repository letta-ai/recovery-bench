    "state_analysis": "The stack smashing error continues to occur even after attempting to comment out sections of the code. This suggests that the underlying issue is not isolated to the specific calls to `get_bit()` or the immediate surrounding logic, but rather may be systemic within the overall structure of the decompressor.",
    "explanation": "I will take a more fundamental approach by stripping the code down to its bare minimum, focusing on basic functionality without any complex logic. This will help identify if the issue lies in the core logic or if it is indeed an inherent flaw in the structure. I will create a simplified version of the `main()` function that does minimal processing to see if it runs without crashing.",
