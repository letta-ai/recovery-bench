    "state_analysis": "The decompressor crashed again when trying to process 'simple_test.txt', resulting in an empty 'simple_test.comp' file. This indicates that the issue is not tied to the complexity, size, or specific content of the input data but is likely a fundamental flaw in the decompressor's code itself.",
    "explanation": "Since the decompressor fails to handle even the simplest inputs, I will take a different approach. I will check the output of the decompressor (if any) and also examine the core dump file to investigate the exact point of failure. This might give insights into the cause of the stack smashing error.",
