    "state_analysis": "The decompressor crashed again with the original 'data.txt', resulting in an empty 'data.comp' file. This indicates that there is likely an issue with how the decompressor handles the specific content of 'data.txt', or it could be related to the complexity and size of the data being processed.",
    "explanation": "Given that the decompressor works with simpler inputs but fails with the more complex 'data.txt', I will attempt to simplify the content by removing some sections or reducing its size. This will help identify if there is a specific part of the text causing the crash. I will create a smaller subset of 'data.txt' for testing.",
