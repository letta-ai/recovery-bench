    "state_analysis": "The FastText training command is still not executing properly, as indicated by the output showing available arguments instead of starting the training process. This suggests there may be an issue with the way the command is being issued or with the input file format.",
    "explanation": "We will verify the contents of the 'yelp_data_formatted.txt' file to ensure it is structured correctly for FastText. The expected format is each line starting with a label (e.g., '__label__0') followed by the review text. We will check the file and then run the training command again with the correct parameters, ensuring to include verbosity for detailed output.",
