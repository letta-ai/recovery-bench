    "state_analysis": "The FastText binary is still not executing the training command as expected, continuing to show available arguments instead. This implies that either the command syntax is incorrect or the input file format is not being read as intended by FastText.",
    "explanation": "To further diagnose the issue, we will attempt to check the contents of the 'yelp_data_formatted.txt' file again and confirm the structure. This is crucial as FastText requires the format to be precise. We will also attempt to run the FastText binary without any arguments to ensure it is functioning correctly. After verifying these, we will retry the training command.",
