    "state_analysis": "The FastText training command is still not executing correctly, as indicated by the consistent output showing available arguments instead of performing the training. This suggests an ongoing issue with how the command is being issued or the format of the input file.",
    "explanation": "To continue troubleshooting, we will double-check the contents of 'yelp_data_formatted.txt' to ensure it is structured appropriately for FastText. We will also confirm the functionality of the FastText binary by executing it without arguments to see if it runs correctly. After verifying these aspects, we will retry the training command with an emphasis on correct syntax.",
