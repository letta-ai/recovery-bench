    "explanation": "To troubleshoot effectively, we will check the contents of 'yelp_data_formatted.txt' again to ensure it adheres to the expected structure. We will also confirm the functionality of the FastText binary by executing it without arguments to see if it runs correctly. Once we verify the formatting, we will retry the training command with a clearer command structure.",
