            "content": "y complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank.\n1       Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor,\nterrible staff.  It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that\nor wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medica\nl needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldbe\nrg 2 stars.\n3       Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is reall\ny all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is\nvery patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medica\nl health and your life.\n3       Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.  He will be missed very much.  \\n\\n\nI think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!\n0       I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. J\nohnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medica\ntion refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescript\nions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you thro\nugh to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing su\nch frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better\n and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doc\ntor who is all about the money.\n4       Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he\nwent to one of the best medical schools in the country. \\nIt is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is gr\neat.\n4       Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldber\ng is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look f\norward to being his patients for many years to come.\n0       I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message\n with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \\n\\nSecond, and most important, mak\ne sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I\ntold him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I\ncan't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make su\nre my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the o\nffice staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!\n1       Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a\n wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.\n2       Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open\ntype rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at ni\nght which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?).\ncat: write error: Broken pipe\nroot@81a07da8a584:/app/data/fastText#\n"

            "content": "y complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank.\n1       Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor,\nterrible staff.  It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that\nor wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medica\nl needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldbe\nrg 2 stars.\n3       Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is reall\ny all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is\nvery patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medica\nl health and your life.\n3       Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.  He will be missed very much.  \\n\\n\nI think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!\n0       I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. J\nohnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medica\ntion refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescript\nions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you thro\nugh to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing su\nch frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better\n and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doc\ntor who is all about the money.\n4       Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he\nwent to one of the best medical schools in the country. \\nIt is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is gr\neat.\n4       Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldber\ng is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look f\norward to being his patients for many years to come.\n0       I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message\n with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \\n\\nSecond, and most important, mak\ne sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I\ntold him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I\ncan't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make su\nre my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the o\nffice staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!\n1       Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a\n wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.\n2       Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open\ntype rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at ni\nght which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?).\ncat: write error: Broken pipe\nroot@81a07da8a584:/app/data/fastText#\n"

It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that\nor wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medica\nl needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldbe\nrg 2 stars.\n3       Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is reall\ny all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is\nvery patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medica\nl health and your life.\n3       Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.  He will be missed very much.  \\n\\n\nI think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!\n0       I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. J\nohnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medica\ntion refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescript\nions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you thro\nugh to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing su\nch frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better\n and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doc\ntor who is all about the money.\n4       Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he\nwent to one of the best medical schools in the country. \\nIt is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is gr\neat.\n4       Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldber\ng is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look f\norward to being his patients for many years to come.\n0       I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message\n with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \\n\\nSecond, and most important, mak\ne sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I\ntold him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I\ncan't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make su\nre my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the o\nffice staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!\n1       Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a\n wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent.\n2       Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open\ntype rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at ni\nght which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?).\ncat: write error: Broken pipe\nroot@81a07da8a584:/app/data/fastText#\n"
