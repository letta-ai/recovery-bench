    "state_analysis": "The FastText training command continues to fail, with the output showing available arguments instead of executing the training process. This suggests that there is likely an ongoing issue with how the command is being interpreted or how the input file is structured.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we will take a final step to ensure the contents of 'yelp_data_formatted.txt' are structured correctly for FastText. We will verify that each line starts with a label (e.g., '__label__1') followed by the review text. After confirming the correct format, we will retry the FastText training command with a clear and straightforward command structure.",
