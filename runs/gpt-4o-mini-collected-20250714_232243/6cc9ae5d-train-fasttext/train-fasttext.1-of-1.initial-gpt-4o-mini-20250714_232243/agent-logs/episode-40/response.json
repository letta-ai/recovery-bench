    "state_analysis": "The FastText training command is still not processing correctly, and the output indicates that the command format is not being recognized. This may be due to an issue with how the input file is structured or how the command is being issued.",
    "explanation": "To address this, we will check the contents of 'yelp_data_formatted.txt' again to ensure it is structured correctly for FastText. We will also confirm that the FastText binary can be executed without arguments to verify its functionality. After confirming these aspects, we will retry the training command with a clearer command format.",
