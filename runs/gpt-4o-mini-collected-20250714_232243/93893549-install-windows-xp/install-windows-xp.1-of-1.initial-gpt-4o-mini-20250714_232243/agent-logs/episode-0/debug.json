Create the virtual hard disk as `/app/isos/xp.vhd` to install windows and store your Windows XP ISO as `/app/isos/xp.iso`. The administrator account should be named `tb-admin`.\n\nVNC Configuration Requirements:\n- Configure QEMU to use VNC display :1 \n- Ensure VNC server is listening on port 5901\n- Set up a web interface (nginx) on port 80 for remote access\n\nThe VM should be left running in the background once started. You will have completed your objective when qemu is at the windows xp login screen and the VNC interface is accessible for monitoring.\n\nYour response must be a JSON object that matches this schema:\n\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"Command\": {\n      \"additionalProperties\": false,\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"keystrokes\": {\n          \"description\": \"Keystrokes to execute in the terminal.
