However, the gcc compilation command is still running or has stalled, indicating persistent issues with the C code that prevent it from compiling successfully. The warning about extra tokens at the end of the #include directive suggests that the file may still not be formatted correctly, which could lead to an undefined reference to main and other compilation errors.",

We will also check if the reconstructed.ppm file exists after the compile attempts. If necessary, we may need to manually inspect the contents of image.c to ensure it is correct.",
