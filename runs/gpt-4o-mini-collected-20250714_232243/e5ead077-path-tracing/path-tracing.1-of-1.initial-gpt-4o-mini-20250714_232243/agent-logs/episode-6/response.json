    "state_analysis": "The C code is still not being correctly formatted and written to the image.c file, leading to compilation errors. The compiler is unable to recognize the main function due to the extra tokens at the end of the #include directives and formatting issues with the code. Consequently, the executable image does not exist, resulting in the 'No such file or directory' error when trying to run it.",
    "explanation": "We need to ensure that the code in image.c is formatted correctly and that we are not using escape sequences that could cause issues. I will write the entire code properly formatted in one go to avoid confusion with line breaks or escape characters. After creating the file, we will compile and execute it again.",
