The code continues to have extra tokens at the end of the #include directives, leading to compilation errors and an inability to create the executable file. Consequently, the './image' command results in a 'No such file or directory' error.",

This will ensure that the code is properly formatted and compile successfully. After creating the file, I will compile and run it to generate the image.",
