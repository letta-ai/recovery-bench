    "instruction": "I've put an image at image.ppm that I rendered programmatically. Write a c program image.c that I can run and compile and will generate an image that's as close as possible to the image I put here.\nSpecifically, I will compute the normalized L2 similarity in [0,1] and yours must match with 0.98 similarity.\nYour image.c file should not read image.ppm, or otherwise read that image file. Your output should be to a new file reconstructed.ppm.\nI will test it by calling gcc -o image image.c -lm && ./image and expect that the reconstructed file will be basically identical.",
