    "state_analysis": "The build-essential package has been successfully installed, providing the necessary compilers for building software. However, the configure command failed because the option '--enable-gcov' is not recognized. This suggests that the SQLite version being used does not support gcov instrumentation with that option. As a result, no Makefile was generated during the configuration process, leading to failure in the make command.",
    "explanation": "We will now run the configure command without the '--enable-gcov' option and then attempt to compile SQLite again. If successful, we will then copy the compiled binary to the appropriate location and update the PATH as needed.",
