However, the logic to modify the .DAT files is still missing. Next, we need to analyze the original COBOL program to replicate its functionality in Python. We will start by examining the COBOL program located at /app/src/program.cbl.",

This will enable us to modify the .DAT files correctly, ensuring that the outputs match those produced by running the COBOL program.",
