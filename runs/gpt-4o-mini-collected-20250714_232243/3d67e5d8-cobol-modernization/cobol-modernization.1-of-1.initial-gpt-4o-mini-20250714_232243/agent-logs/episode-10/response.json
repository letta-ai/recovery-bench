    "state_analysis": "The contents of the INPUT.DAT file have been displayed, and it appears that the format is incorrect. The expected format should be four comma-separated values (WS_BUYER_ID, WS_SELLER_ID, WS_AMOUNT, WS_BOOK_ID), but the current line 'U001U002B007200' does not contain any commas, leading to the ValueError during unpacking. This is likely the cause of the errors encountered in the Python script.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, we need to correct the input data in INPUT.DAT to ensure it follows the expected format. Each line should contain four comma-separated values. I will prepare commands to edit the INPUT.DAT file. Alternatively, we could overwrite it with correct sample data for testing purposes.",
