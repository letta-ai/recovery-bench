    "state_analysis": "The command to add error handling to the Python script has been successfully executed. The error handling checks if the data split contains exactly four parts before attempting to unpack them. This should prevent the ValueError from occurring due to improperly formatted lines in the INPUT.DAT file. However, we need to add the print statement and the return statement for the error handling logic to be complete.",
    "explanation": "Next, I will append the necessary lines to the script that print an error message and return from the function if the input line does not contain four values. This will enhance the robustness of the script and allow it to handle invalid input gracefully.",
