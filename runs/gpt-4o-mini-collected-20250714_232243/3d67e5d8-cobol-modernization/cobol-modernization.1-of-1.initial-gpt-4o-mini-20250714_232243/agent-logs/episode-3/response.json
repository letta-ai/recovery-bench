    "state_analysis": "The Python script has been successfully updated with the logic to process account transactions, update the book ownership, and log the transactions. The implementation now reflects the logic provided in the COBOL program. However, we need to finalize the script by adding the necessary imports and a way to read data from the INPUT.DAT file before processing transactions.",
    "explanation": "We will include the necessary imports for the Python script and add the logic to read from the INPUT.DAT file. After reading the data, we will call the `process_transactions` function to handle the transaction logic. This will prepare the script for execution, ensuring that it can read input and produce the desired output files.",
