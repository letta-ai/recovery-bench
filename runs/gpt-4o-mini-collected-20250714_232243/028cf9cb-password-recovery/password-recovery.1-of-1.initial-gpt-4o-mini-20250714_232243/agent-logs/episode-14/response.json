This persistent state suggests that the system is unable to process commands effectively, likely due to resource exhaustion or file corruption.",
    "explanation": "Given the ongoing unresponsiveness of the terminal and inability to execute any commands, I cannot proceed with recovery efforts as intended. The next step is to suggest that the system be restarted or accessed through a different means. If physical access is possible, a hard reboot may be necessary to clear the current state. Alternatively, accessing the logs via a live environment or recovery mode could allow for analysis without the issues present in the current session.",
