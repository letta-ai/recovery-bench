    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains entirely unresponsive, filled with backslashes, indicating that commands are still failing to execute. This suggests a critical issue with the command execution environment, likely due to a severe filesystem problem or resource exhaustion, preventing any effective interaction with the system.",
    "explanation": "At this point, it is clear that further recovery attempts via this session are not feasible. The best course of action is to perform a hard reboot of the system if physical access is available. This should clear the current state and allow the system to start fresh. Following the reboot, filesystem checks should be conducted to address any underlying issues that may have caused the terminal to become unresponsive.",
