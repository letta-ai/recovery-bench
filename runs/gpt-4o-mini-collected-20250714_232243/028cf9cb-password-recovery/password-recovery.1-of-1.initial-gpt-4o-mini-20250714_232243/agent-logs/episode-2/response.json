    "state_analysis": "The filesystem information shows that '/dev/sda1' is mounted at '/logs', meaning my previous command to restore files using 'extundelete' was directed at the wrong device. The search for 'launchcode.txt' returned no results, and neither did the grep search for 'PASSWORD=' in the /app directory. This indicates that there may be no remnants of the password file in the current directory structure.",
    "explanation": "I will now try to explore the '/logs' directory where the '/dev/sda1' is mounted, as it may contain the deleted file or other relevant logs. I will check the contents of the '/logs' directory and look for any files that might contain the password or any backups. Additionally, I will attempt to list all files in the '/app' directory to double-check for any hidden files.",
