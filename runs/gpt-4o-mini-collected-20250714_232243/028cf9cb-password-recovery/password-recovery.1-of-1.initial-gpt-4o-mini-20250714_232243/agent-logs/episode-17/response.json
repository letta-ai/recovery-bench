    "state_analysis": "The terminal output is still filled with backslashes, indicating that commands are not executing successfully. This ongoing issue suggests a severe problem with the terminal or filesystem, likely stemming from the size or corruption of log files, causing the system to become unresponsive to commands.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent unresponsiveness of the terminal, further recovery attempts via this session are not feasible. The best course of action is to reboot the system to restore normal operation. If physical access is possible, a hard reset may be required to clear the current state. After rebooting, I would recommend checking the filesystem for errors and trying to access the logs again in a controlled manner.",
