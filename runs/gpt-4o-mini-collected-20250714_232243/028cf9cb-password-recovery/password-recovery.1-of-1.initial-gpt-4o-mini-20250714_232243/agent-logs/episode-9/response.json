This indicates that the commands to access system resources or files have consistently failed due to an unresponsive terminal state, likely caused by the size or corruption of the log files.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to read from disk or log files have resulted in timeouts, I will try a different approach. I will attempt to terminate the current session and re-establish it to reset the terminal state. If that does not work, I may need to investigate if there is a way to access the files from a different method, such as using a different tool or accessing the logs from a different directory if they are not corrupted.",
