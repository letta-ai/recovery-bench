However, there is still a syntax error in the `ray_cluster.yaml` file because the line for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` is missing a closing quote. This prevents the YAML file from being valid.",
    "explanation": "I will fix the syntax error in the `ray_cluster.yaml` file by adding the missing closing quote for the line that sets the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID placeholder. After making this correction, I will check again to ensure that all sensitive values have been sanitized and that no sensitive information remains in the repository.",
