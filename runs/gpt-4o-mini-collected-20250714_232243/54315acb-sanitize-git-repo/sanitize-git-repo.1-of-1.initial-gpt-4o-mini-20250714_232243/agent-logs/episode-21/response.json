    "state_analysis": "The output from `git diff` shows that the placeholders for AWS credentials have been successfully updated in the `README.md` file. However, the `ray_cluster.yaml` file still contains a syntax error as the line for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` is missing a closing quote. This indicates that sensitive information is still present in the repository and needs to be corrected.",
    "explanation": "I will fix the syntax error in the `ray_cluster.yaml` file by adding the missing closing quote for the line that sets the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` placeholder. After making this correction, I will check again to ensure that all sensitive values have been sanitized and that no sensitive information remains in the repository.",
