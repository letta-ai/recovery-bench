The `git diff` output shows that the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY were replaced correctly in the README.md and ray_cluster.yaml files, indicating that the sensitive information has been sanitized. However, the output shows a missing closing quote in the `ray_cluster.yaml` file that needs to be fixed.",
    "explanation": "I will correct the syntax error in the `ray_cluster.yaml` file by adding the missing closing quote for the line that sets the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID placeholder. After this, I will perform another check to confirm that the sanitization is complete and there are no remaining sensitive values.",
