    "state_analysis": "The SSH service is not recognized, which indicates that it may not be installed or configured on this system. Additionally, the `netstat` command did not return any output for port 8080, suggesting that there are no services listening on that port, likely meaning the web server is not running.",
    "explanation": "Since the SSH service is not running and the web server is not accessible, we need to install and start the SSH server. Also, we need to ensure that a web server is set up and running on port 8080. We can start by installing the OpenSSH server and then check if we have a web server like Apache or Nginx to install and configure.",
