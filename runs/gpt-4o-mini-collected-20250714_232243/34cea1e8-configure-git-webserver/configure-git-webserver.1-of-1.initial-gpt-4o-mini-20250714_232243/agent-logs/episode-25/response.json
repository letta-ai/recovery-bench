The server is reachable, but without proper credentials, we cannot proceed with pushing changes to the repository or checking permissions.",

Additionally, we should check if the user has the necessary permissions on the repository. We can try to connect to the server using a different method or consult the server administrator to confirm credentials and permissions.",
