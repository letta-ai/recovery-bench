The server is reachable, but the password provided for the user account is not correct, which is causing the permission denied error. The SSH service is running, but without valid credentials, we cannot push to the Git repository.",
    "explanation": "To proceed, we need to ensure that the correct username and password are being used for the Git server. If the password is not known or valid, it will need to be reset or confirmed on the server. Additionally, if the user account does not have the necessary permissions to push to the repository, this will also need to be addressed. Let's attempt to gather more information about the user account and its permissions on the Git server.",
