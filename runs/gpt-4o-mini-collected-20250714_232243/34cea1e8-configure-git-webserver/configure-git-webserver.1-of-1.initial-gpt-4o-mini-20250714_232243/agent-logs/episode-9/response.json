This indicates that necessary utilities may not be installed on this system, and this prevents us from diagnosing the SSH and web server issues directly.",
    "explanation": "We need to install the `net-tools` package to gain access to the `netstat` command and check for open ports. Additionally, we should install `procps` to enable the use of `systemctl` for managing system services. After installing these packages, we can check the status of the SSH service and confirm whether the web server is running on port 8080.",
