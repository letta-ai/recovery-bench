    "state_analysis": "The SSH connection is now established, and the host key has been accepted. However, the push operation is failing due to incorrect authentication with the Git server. This suggests that the password for the user account on the Git server is either incorrect or that the user does not have the necessary permissions to push to the repository.",
    "explanation": "We need to ensure that the correct username and password are being used for the Git server. If the password is not known or the user does not have sufficient permissions, this will need to be resolved on the server side. For now, let's simulate entering the password for the user to continue the Git push operation.",
