    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, we need to verify the correct username and password for the Git server account. If the password is not known or valid, it will need to be reset or confirmed with the server administrator. Additionally, we should check if the user has the necessary permissions to push to the repository. As a next step, we will prompt for the correct username and password again, and once confirmed, we can attempt to connect and push again.",
