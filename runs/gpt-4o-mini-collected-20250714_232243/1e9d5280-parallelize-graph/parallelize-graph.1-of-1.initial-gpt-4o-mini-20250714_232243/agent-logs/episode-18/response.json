    "state_analysis": "The `pgen` executable is still failing to run due to issues with connecting to SSH on localhost, which is necessary for GASNet to handle parallel execution. The SSH service does not seem to be recognized or running in the current environment, leading to connection errors when attempting to run the program with the required node specifications.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we need to ensure that the SSH daemon is installed and running properly. If it is not installed, we can install it and then start the SSH service. After ensuring SSH is operational, we will attempt to run the `pgen` executable again to verify its output against the `serial` output.",
