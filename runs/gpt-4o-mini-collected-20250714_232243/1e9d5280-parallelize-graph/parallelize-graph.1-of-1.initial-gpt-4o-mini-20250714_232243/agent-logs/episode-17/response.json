    "state_analysis": "The `pgen` executable was run with the correct number of nodes, but it failed because it attempted to connect to SSH on localhost and was refused. This suggests that the necessary SSH service is not running, which is required for GASNet to manage node communication in parallel execution.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we can start the SSH server on the local machine. This will allow the `pgen` executable to communicate over SSH as required by GASNet. After starting the SSH service, we will rerun the `pgen` command to see if it executes successfully and produces output that can be compared to the output from the `serial` executable.",
