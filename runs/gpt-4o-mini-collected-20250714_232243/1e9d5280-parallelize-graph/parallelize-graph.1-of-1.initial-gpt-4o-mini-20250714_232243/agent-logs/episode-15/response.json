    "state_analysis": "The executables `serial` and `pgen` were compiled successfully, and the output files `serial.out` and `pgen.out` were generated. However, running the `pgen` executable encountered an error due to incorrect usage; it requires specifying the number of nodes and additional program arguments. This is a common requirement for parallel programs that utilize GASNet for communication.",
    "explanation": "To proceed, we need to run the `pgen` executable with the appropriate number of nodes and any required arguments. Since the task is to parallelize the de Bruijn graph construction, we can start with a single node for testing purposes. After running the `pgen` command correctly, we will compare the outputs of both executables again to verify their correctness.",
