    "state_analysis": "The `upcc` and related commands are available in the `/usr/local/opt/bin` directory, but the `upc` command, which is invoked by the Makefile, is not found. The Makefile is attempting to call `upc` instead of `upcc`, which is causing the compilation error. Additionally, there is no `clean` rule defined in the Makefile, which results in an error when trying to run `make clean`.",
