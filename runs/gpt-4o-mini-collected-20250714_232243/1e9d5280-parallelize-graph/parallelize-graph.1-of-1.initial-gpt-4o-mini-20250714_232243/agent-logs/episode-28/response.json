    "state_analysis": "The attempt to modify `serial.c` to include proper file reading logic failed because the code was not formatted correctly during the echo command, leading to a syntax error. The `gcc` command did not compile the `serial` executable successfully, resulting in the file not being created. Consequently, when trying to run `./serial`, it returned a 'No such file or directory' error.",
    "explanation": "We need to correct the echo command that creates the `serial.c` file to ensure that the C code is formatted properly without escape sequences. After fixing the code, we will recompile the `serial` executable and test it again with the input file. Let's rewrite the `serial.c` correctly and proceed with the compilation.",
