    "state_analysis": "The Makefile has successfully executed the `gcc` command to compile the serial version, but there is a syntax error in the source file `serial.c`. The `#include` statements are incorrectly formatted, which has caused a compilation error indicating an undefined reference to `main`. This suggests that the source code was not correctly created due to the inclusion of newline escape sequences instead of actual newlines.",
    "explanation": "We need to correct the creation of the `serial.c` and `pgen.c` files by ensuring that the code is formatted properly without escape sequences. Then, we will recompile the executables using the `make` command again.",
