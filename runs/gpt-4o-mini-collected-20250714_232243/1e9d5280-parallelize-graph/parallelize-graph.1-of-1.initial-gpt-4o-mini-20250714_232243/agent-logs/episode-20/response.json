    "state_analysis": "The SSH service has started successfully, but when attempting to run the `pgen` executable, it still prompts for a password for the `localhost` user. This indicates that passwordless SSH login has not been configured successfully. The connection was then closed, leading to the termination of the process.",
    "explanation": "To allow the `pgen` executable to run without prompting for a password, we need to ensure that the SSH key pair has been correctly generated and that the public key has been added to the `authorized_keys` file for the `localhost` user. We will reattempt the SSH key generation and setup to avoid the password prompt. After configuring SSH keys correctly, we will run the `pgen` command again.",
