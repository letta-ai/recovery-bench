    "state_analysis": "The `pgen` executable was attempted with the correct number of nodes, but it encountered an error related to the `SSH_SERVERS` environment variable, which is needed for spawning SPMD worker threads in GASNet. This indicates that the parallel execution environment is not properly set up, which is necessary for running UPC applications using GASNet.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we need to set the `SSH_SERVERS` environment variable to indicate the nodes available for the UPC program. Since we are running locally, we can set it to `localhost`. After configuring this environment variable, we will attempt to run the `pgen` executable again with the appropriate arguments.",
