However, it is prompting for a password to connect to localhost via SSH. This indicates that the SSH configuration is expecting authentication, which is typical in a secured environment.",
    "explanation": "To proceed without being prompted for a password, we can create an SSH key pair and add the public key to the authorized keys for the root user on localhost. This will allow passwordless SSH login. After setting up the SSH keys, we will attempt to run the `pgen` executable again to verify its output.",
