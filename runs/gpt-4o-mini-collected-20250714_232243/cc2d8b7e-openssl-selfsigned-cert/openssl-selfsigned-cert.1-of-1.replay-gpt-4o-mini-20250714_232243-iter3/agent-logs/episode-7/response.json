The private key permissions are still set to 600, which is correct, but the certificate and PEM files permissions are also set to 644, which is fine. However, repeated attempts suggest there might be a misunderstanding or an incomplete step in the process.",

We will also ensure that the permissions are correctly set for the private key and the certificate files, and recheck the Python script to confirm it can successfully load the certificate.",
