    "explanation": "To resolve this issue: 1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**: Go to your GitHub account settings, navigate to Developer settings, and create a new personal access token with `repo` permissions. 2. **Set the Remote URL**: Once you have the token, make sure to replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` with your actual GitHub username and the token. For example: `git remote set-url origin https://your_actual_username:your_actual_token@github.com/username/repository.git` without angle brackets. 3. **Push the Changes Again**: After setting the remote URL correctly, attempt to push the changes again.",
