The error messages indicate that the personal access token is not recognized, which suggests it may not be valid or lacks the required permissions. The repeated errors confirm that password authentication is no longer supported.",

Ensure you replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` in the command with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token directly, without angle brackets or quotes.
