    "state_analysis": "The terminal output consistently shows failures in authentication attempts when pushing to the GitHub repository. The error indicates that the personal access token is not being recognized, suggesting it may not be set up correctly or lacks the necessary permissions. Additionally, the error messages confirm that password authentication is no longer supported by GitHub.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, please ensure that you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the necessary permissions (like `repo`). Ensure you replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly in the command with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token, without angle brackets or quotes. Once the remote URL is set correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
