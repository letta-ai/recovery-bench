The error messages confirm that password authentication is not supported and that the personal access token is not being recognized, suggesting it may not be valid or not formatted correctly in the command.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, ensure that you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the required permissions (like `repo`). You need to enter your actual GitHub username and the personal access token directly into the command, replacing `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` without angle brackets or quotes.
