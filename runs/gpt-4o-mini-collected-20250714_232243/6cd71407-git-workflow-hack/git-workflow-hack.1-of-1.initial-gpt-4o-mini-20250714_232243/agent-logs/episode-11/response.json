    "state_analysis": "The terminal output shows that the authentication attempts continue to fail when trying to push to the remote repository. The command to set the remote URL with a personal access token is being misinterpreted as a shell command, leading to 'No such file or directory' errors. The push attempts are still failing due to the lack of proper authentication, as GitHub no longer supports password authentication for HTTPS.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this authentication issue, ensure that you are replacing `<YourGitHubUsername>` and `<YourValidPersonalAccessToken>` with your actual GitHub username and a valid personal access token in the command. This should be done in the Git command directly, not as placeholders. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
