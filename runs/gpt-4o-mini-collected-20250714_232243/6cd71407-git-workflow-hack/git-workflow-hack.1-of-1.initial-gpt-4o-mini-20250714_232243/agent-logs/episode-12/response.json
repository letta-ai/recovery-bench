    "state_analysis": "The terminal output indicates that the push command fails due to authentication issues. Even after attempting to set the remote URL with a personal access token, the command still fails because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for HTTPS. The personal access token must be used in the remote URL, but it seems the format or token may not be correct.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, please verify that you are generating a personal access token in GitHub with the correct scopes (e.g., 'repo') and that you are using it properly in the command. Make sure to replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` with your GitHub username and the actual personal access token. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
