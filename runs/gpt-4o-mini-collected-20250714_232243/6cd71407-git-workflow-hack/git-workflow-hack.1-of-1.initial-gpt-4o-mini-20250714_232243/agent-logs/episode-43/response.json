    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, ensure that you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the required permissions (e.g., 'repo'). Ensure you replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` in the command with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token directly, without angle brackets or quotes.
