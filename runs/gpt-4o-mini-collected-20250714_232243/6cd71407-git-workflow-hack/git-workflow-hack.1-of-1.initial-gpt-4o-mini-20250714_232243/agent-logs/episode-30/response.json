The errors indicate that the personal access token is not being recognized, suggesting that it may not be valid or that the URL is not formatted correctly. GitHub's removal of password authentication is confirmed in the repeated error messages.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, ensure that you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the necessary permissions (like `repo`). Make sure to replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` in the command with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token directly, without angle brackets or quotes. Once the remote URL is set correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
