The error indicates that password authentication is no longer supported by GitHub. Attempts to set the remote URL with a personal access token are still being misinterpreted or not applied correctly, leading to these persistent failures.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, please verify that you have generated a personal access token from GitHub with the appropriate permissions (such as `repo`). Make sure to enter your actual GitHub username and your personal access token directly into the command, replacing `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` without angle brackets or quotes.
