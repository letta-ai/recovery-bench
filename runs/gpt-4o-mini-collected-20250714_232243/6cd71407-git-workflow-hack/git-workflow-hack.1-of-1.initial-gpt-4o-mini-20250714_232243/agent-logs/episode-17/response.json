This indicates that the personal access token may not be set correctly or lacks the required permissions. The error message confirms that GitHub no longer supports password authentication for HTTPS connections, further complicating the push attempts.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, please ensure you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with appropriate permissions (such as `repo`). Make sure to replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly in the command without angle brackets or quotes. After correctly setting the remote URL, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
