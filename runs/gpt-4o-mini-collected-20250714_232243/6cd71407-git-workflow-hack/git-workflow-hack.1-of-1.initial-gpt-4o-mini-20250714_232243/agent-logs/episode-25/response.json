The message confirms that password authentication is no longer supported by GitHub, and it seems that the personal access token is either not being recognized correctly or lacks the necessary permissions.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, ensure that you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the necessary permissions (such as `repo`). You must enter your actual GitHub username and the personal access token directly into the command, replacing `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` without angle brackets or quotes.
