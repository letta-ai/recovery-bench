The error indicates that the personal access token is not being recognized or is not valid. The command to set the remote URL appears to be incorrectly formatted or the token may not have sufficient permissions.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, please ensure that you have generated a personal access token from GitHub with proper permissions (e.g., 'repo'). You must enter your actual GitHub username and the personal access token directly into the command, replacing `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` without angle brackets or quotes. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
