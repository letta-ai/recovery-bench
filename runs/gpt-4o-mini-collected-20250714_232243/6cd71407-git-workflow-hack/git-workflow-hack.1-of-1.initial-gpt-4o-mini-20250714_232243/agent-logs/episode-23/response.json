Repeated errors confirm that password authentication is no longer supported by GitHub, and attempts to authenticate using the personal access token are not being recognized correctly.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, ensure that you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the appropriate scopes (like `repo`). You must enter your actual GitHub username and the personal access token directly into the command, replacing `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` without angle brackets. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
