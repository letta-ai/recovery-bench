The repeated messages specify that password authentication is not supported, which aligns with GitHub's current authentication policies.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, ensure that you have created a personal access token from your GitHub account with the appropriate permissions (like `repo`). You need to enter your actual GitHub username and the personal access token directly into the command, replacing `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly, without angle brackets or quotes.
