The repeated message confirms that password authentication has been removed and suggests that the personal access token is either not valid or not formatted correctly in the remote URL, resulting in continued failures to push changes.",
    "explanation": "To fix this issue, ensure that you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the appropriate permissions (like `repo`). You must enter your actual GitHub username and the personal access token directly into the command, replacing `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly without angle brackets or quotes. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
