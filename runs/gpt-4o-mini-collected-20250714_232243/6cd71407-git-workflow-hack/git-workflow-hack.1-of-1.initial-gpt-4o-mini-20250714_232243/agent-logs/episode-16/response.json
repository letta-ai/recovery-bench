    "state_analysis": "The terminal output indicates that authentication continues to fail when pushing to GitHub, confirming that the personal access token may not be formatted correctly or the token itself may not have the required permissions. The repeated errors suggest that the repository URL is not being set correctly due to shell command misinterpretation.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, please ensure that you are entering your actual GitHub username and a valid personal access token directly into the command, replacing `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token`. Make sure the token has appropriate scopes (like `repo`) when generated. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
