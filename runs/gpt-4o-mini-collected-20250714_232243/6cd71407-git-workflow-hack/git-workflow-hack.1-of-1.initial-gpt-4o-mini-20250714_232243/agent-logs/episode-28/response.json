This indicates that the personal access token may still not be valid or correctly formatted in the command. The error messages confirm that password authentication is not supported, which is expected since it was removed from GitHub.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, please ensure that you have created a personal access token from your GitHub account with the appropriate permissions (such as `repo`). Make sure to replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly in the command with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token, without angle brackets or quotes. Once the remote URL is set correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
