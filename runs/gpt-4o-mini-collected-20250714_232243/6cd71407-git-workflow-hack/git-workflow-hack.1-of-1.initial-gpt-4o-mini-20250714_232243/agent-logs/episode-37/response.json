    "state_analysis": "The terminal output shows continued authentication failures when attempting to push to the GitHub repository. This indicates that the personal access token is still either not valid or not formatted correctly in the command. The error messages confirm that password authentication is not supported, which is consistent with GitHub's policy changes.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, please ensure you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the appropriate scopes (such as `repo`). It is crucial to replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly in the command without angle brackets or quotes. After correctly setting the remote URL, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
