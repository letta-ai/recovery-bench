The error messages indicate that the personal access token is either invalid or not formatted correctly. The continuing failures suggest that the setup for the token in the remote URL is incorrect or not recognized by GitHub.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, please ensure that you have created a valid personal access token on your GitHub account with the necessary permissions (such as `repo`). Ensure you replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly in the command with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token, without angle brackets or quotes. After correcting the remote URL, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
