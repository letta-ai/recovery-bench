    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to display authentication failures when trying to push to the GitHub repository. It appears that the personal access token is still not being recognized, indicating it may not be valid or properly formatted in the command. The error messages confirm that password authentication is not supported, which is expected.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, please ensure that you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the appropriate permissions (like `repo`). You must enter your actual GitHub username and the personal access token directly into the command, replacing `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly without angle brackets or quotes. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
