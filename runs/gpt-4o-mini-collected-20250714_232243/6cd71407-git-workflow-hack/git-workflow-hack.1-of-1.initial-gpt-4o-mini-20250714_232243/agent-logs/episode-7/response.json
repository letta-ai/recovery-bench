    "state_analysis": "The terminal indicates repeated authentication failures when trying to push to the remote repository. The issue stems from incorrect formatting when setting the remote URL with the personal access token, leading to attempts to authenticate with a malformed URL. The repository still cannot be accessed due to authentication issues, as GitHub no longer accepts password authentication for HTTPS.",

After ensuring the remote URL is set properly, we will try the push command again. Please ensure that the personal access token has the necessary permissions for repository access (e.g., 'repo' scope).",
