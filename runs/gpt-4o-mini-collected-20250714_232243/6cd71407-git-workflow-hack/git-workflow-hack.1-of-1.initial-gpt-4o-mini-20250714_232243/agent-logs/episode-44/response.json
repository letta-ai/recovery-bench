The repeated messages confirm that password authentication is not supported, which is consistent with GitHub's current policies.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, ensure that you have generated a valid personal access token from your GitHub account with the necessary permissions (e.g., 'repo'). Make sure you replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly in the command with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token, without angle brackets or quotes.
