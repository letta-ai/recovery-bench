The issue stems from the incorrect attempts to set the remote URL with a personal access token, which resulted in the command being misinterpreted as a shell command. The repository is not being recognized, causing repeated authentication failures.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, I will provide clear instructions for entering the correct remote URL format. I will also ensure that the personal access token is correctly placed in the command. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes once again. Please generate a personal access token from GitHub with the appropriate permissions if you haven't already.",
