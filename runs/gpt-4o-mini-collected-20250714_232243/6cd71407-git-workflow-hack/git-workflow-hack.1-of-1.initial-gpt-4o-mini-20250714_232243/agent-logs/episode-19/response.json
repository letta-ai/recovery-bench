The message confirms that password authentication is no longer supported, and it seems that the personal access token is not being used correctly in the remote URL, leading to repeated failures.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, please ensure that you are using a valid personal access token that has been created in your GitHub account with the appropriate permissions (like `repo`). Make sure to replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token directly in the command without angle brackets or quotes. Once the remote URL is set correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
