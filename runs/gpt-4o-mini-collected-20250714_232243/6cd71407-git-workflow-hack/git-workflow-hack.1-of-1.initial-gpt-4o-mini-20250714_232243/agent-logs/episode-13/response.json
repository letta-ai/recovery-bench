The error indicates that password authentication is no longer supported by GitHub, and the attempts to set the remote URL with a personal access token are being misinterpreted or not applied correctly, causing incorrect authentication.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, please ensure that you are using a personal access token created from your GitHub account with the appropriate scopes (like `repo`). Make sure to replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` in the command with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
