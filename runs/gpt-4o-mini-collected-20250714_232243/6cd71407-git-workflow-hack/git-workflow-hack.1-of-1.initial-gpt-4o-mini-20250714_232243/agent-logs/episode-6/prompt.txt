Previous command:
keystrokes='git push -u origin website-project\n' is_blocking=True timeout_sec=10.0

The previous command timed out after 10.0 seconds

It is possible that the command is not yet finished executing. If that is the case, then do nothing. It is also possible that you have entered an interactive shell and should continue sending keystrokes as normal.

Here is the current state of the terminal:


  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
