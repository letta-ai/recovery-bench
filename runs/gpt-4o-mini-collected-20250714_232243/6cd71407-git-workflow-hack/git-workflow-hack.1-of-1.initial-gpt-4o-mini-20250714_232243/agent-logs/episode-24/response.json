The error indicates that password authentication is no longer supported, and attempts to set the remote URL with a personal access token are not being recognized or are invalid.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, please ensure you have generated a personal access token from your GitHub account with the required scopes (like `repo`). It is crucial to replace `your_actual_username` and `your_actual_token` directly in the command with your actual GitHub username and the valid personal access token, without angle brackets or quotes. After setting the remote URL correctly, we will attempt to push the changes again.",
