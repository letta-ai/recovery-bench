    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and the command to read the `test.qdp` file has timed out once again. Multiple attempts to read the file have not succeeded, suggesting ongoing issues with the command or the environment itself.",
    "explanation": "To try and resolve this issue, we will perform a complete reset of the tmux session and recreate the `test.qdp` file. Once recreated, we will ensure that the file is formatted correctly before trying to read it again. This will involve checking the contents of the file right after creation and attempting to read it immediately.",
