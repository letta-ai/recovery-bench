    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains unresponsive, with each attempt to read the `test.qdp` file timing out. The repeated failures suggest that either the commands are not executing properly, or there is an underlying issue with the environment that is preventing commands from being processed.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, we will perform a complete reset of the tmux server to clear any lingering processes or unresponsive states. After restarting the tmux session, we will create the `test.qdp` file, check its contents, and then attempt to read it using Python. This will help us ensure the commands are executed in a clean environment.",
