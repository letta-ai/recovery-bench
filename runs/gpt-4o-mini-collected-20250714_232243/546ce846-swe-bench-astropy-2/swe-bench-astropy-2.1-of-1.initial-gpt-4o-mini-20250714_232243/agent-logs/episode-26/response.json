    "explanation": "To address this, we will take a fresh approach by ensuring that we completely terminate the tmux server and start a new session. After the new session starts, we will create the `test.qdp` file and immediately check its contents before running the read command to confirm it is formatted correctly. This approach will help us ensure that the environment is clear and ready for execution.",
