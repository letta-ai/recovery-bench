    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains unresponsive, with the command to read the `test.qdp` file timing out once again. This consistent failure indicates that there are likely unresolved issues in the environment or with the command execution itself.",
    "explanation": "To attempt to resolve this, we will perform a complete termination of the tmux server and start a new session. After the new session starts, we will create the `test.qdp` file and immediately check its contents before trying to read it with Python. This will help ensure that the file is formatted correctly and that the environment is functioning properly.",
