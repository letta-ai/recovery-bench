    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to be unresponsive, with attempts to read the `test.qdp` file timing out repeatedly. This suggests that there is a persistent issue with the environment or the execution of commands that is preventing them from being processed correctly.",
    "explanation": "To attempt to resolve this, we will execute a final reset of the tmux server, ensuring that all lingering processes are terminated. After restarting the server, we will create the `test.qdp` file, check its contents, and then attempt to read it again with Python. This will help verify that the environment is functioning properly and that the file is formatted correctly.",
