    "state_analysis": "The terminal environment is still unresponsive, and attempts to read the contents of the `test.qdp` file are failing. The persistent timeouts suggest there is a fundamental issue with how the commands are being executed or a problem within the tmux session itself.",
    "explanation": "We need to ensure that the `test.qdp` file is being created correctly and that the commands to read it are properly executed. To address this, we will recreate the `test.qdp` file once more and directly verify its contents immediately after creation. This will help confirm whether the file is formatted correctly before trying to read it with Python again.",
