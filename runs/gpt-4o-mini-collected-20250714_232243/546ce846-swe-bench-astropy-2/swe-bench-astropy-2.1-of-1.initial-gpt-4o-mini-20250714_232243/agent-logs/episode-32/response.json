    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, we will perform a definitive reset of the tmux server to clear all processes. After restarting, we will create the `test.qdp` file and immediately check its contents before executing the Python command to read it. This will help us verify that the file is formatted correctly and that the environment is ready for execution.",
