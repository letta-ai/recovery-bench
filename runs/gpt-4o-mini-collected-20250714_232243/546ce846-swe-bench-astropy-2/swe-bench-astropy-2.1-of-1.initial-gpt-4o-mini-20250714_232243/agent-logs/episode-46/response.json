    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to hang, and attempts to read the `test.qdp` file have consistently timed out. This suggests that there is a persistent issue with executing commands in the environment, likely due to lingering processes or other underlying problems.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, we will ensure a complete termination of the tmux server and then start a new session. After creating a new session, we will create the `test.qdp` file and check its contents immediately before trying to read it using Python. This will help verify that the file is formatted correctly and that the environment is functioning as expected.",
