    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains unresponsive, with repeated timeouts occurring when trying to read the `test.qdp` file. This indicates that there are unresolved issues in the environment affecting command execution, possibly due to lingering processes or misconfiguration.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we will take the following steps: ensure that the tmux server is completely terminated, create a new session, and then create the `test.qdp` file. Immediately afterward, we will check its contents and attempt to read it using Python. This process will help confirm whether the file is correctly formatted and if the environment is functioning properly.",
