The commands executed do not seem to be processed correctly, indicating potential issues with the environment, lingering processes, or a misconfiguration with how the commands are being executed.",
    "explanation": "To troubleshoot further, we will completely terminate the tmux server and start anew. After creating a new session, we will create the `test.qdp` file and immediately check its contents to confirm it is formatted correctly before trying to read it with Python. This will help ensure that the file is valid and that the environment is reset properly.",
