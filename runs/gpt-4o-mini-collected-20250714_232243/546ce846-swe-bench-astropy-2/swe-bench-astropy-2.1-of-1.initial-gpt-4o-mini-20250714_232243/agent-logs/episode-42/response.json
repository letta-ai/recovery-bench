    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and attempts to read the `test.qdp` file have consistently timed out. This indicates that there might be underlying issues with the command execution environment or lingering processes that have not been properly terminated.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, we will ensure that the tmux server is killed completely and start a fresh session. After creating the new session, we will recreate the `test.qdp` file and immediately check its contents before attempting to read it with Python. This will help confirm that the file is correctly formatted and that the environment is functioning as expected.",
