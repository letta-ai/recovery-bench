    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains unresponsive, with repeated timeouts when trying to read the `test.qdp` file. The consistent command failures indicate that there are likely underlying issues with the environment or processes that have not been cleared properly despite multiple resets.",
    "explanation": "To address this, we will perform a complete shutdown of the tmux server and create a new session from scratch. After creating the new session, we will recreate the `test.qdp` file and check its contents immediately to ensure the file is formatted correctly before trying to read it with Python again.",
