    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to be unresponsive, with attempts to read the `test.qdp` file timing out consistently. This indicates that there may be ongoing issues with the environment, possibly due to lingering processes or misconfigured commands.",
    "explanation": "To try and resolve this, we will restart the tmux server completely to ensure no processes are interfering with command execution. After the restart, we will create the `test.qdp` file and immediately check its contents before running the Python command to read it. This will help us verify that the file is formatted correctly and that the environment is functioning properly.",
