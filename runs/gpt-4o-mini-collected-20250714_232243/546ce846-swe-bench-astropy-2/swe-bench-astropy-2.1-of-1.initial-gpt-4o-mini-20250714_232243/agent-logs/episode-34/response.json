    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and attempts to read the `test.qdp` file have consistently timed out. This suggests that the commands are not being executed properly, possibly due to an issue with the environment or the command structure.",
    "explanation": "To troubleshoot further, we will perform a definitive reset of the tmux server to ensure all processes are cleared. After restarting, we will create the `test.qdp` file, verify its contents immediately, and then attempt to read it using Python. This approach will help us confirm whether the file is formatted correctly and whether the environment is functioning as expected.",
