    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to hang, with repeated timeouts occurring when trying to read the `test.qdp` file. This indicates that there are likely unresolved issues affecting command execution within the environment, possibly due to lingering processes or misconfigurations.",
    "explanation": "To address this issue, we will make one more attempt to completely reset the tmux server. After ensuring it is fully terminated, we will create a new session, create the `test.qdp` file, and immediately verify its contents before trying to read it with Python. This will help us confirm if the file is formatted correctly and that the environment is operational.",
