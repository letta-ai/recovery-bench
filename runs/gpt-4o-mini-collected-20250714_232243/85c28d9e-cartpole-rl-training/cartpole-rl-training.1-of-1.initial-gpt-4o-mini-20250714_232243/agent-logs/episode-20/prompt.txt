Previous command:
keystrokes='python3.8 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n' is_blocking=True timeout_sec=60.0

The previous command timed out after 60.0 seconds

It is possible that the command is not yet finished executing. If that is the case, then do nothing. It is also possible that you have entered an interactive shell and should continue sending keystrokes as normal.

Here is the current state of the terminal:
