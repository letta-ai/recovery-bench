    "state_analysis": "The most recent error indicates a `NameError` because the variable `bags` is not defined in the global scope of the `test_abmil.py` file. The print statement for `bags.shape` was mistakenly added outside of the method where `bags` is defined, leading to this error.",
    "explanation": "To fix this, I will remove the print statement for `bags.shape` from the global scope of the `test_abmil.py` file and ensure that it is included within the `test_forward` method where `bags` is initialized. After making these adjustments, I will run the tests again to verify that the model functions correctly and that the dimensions align properly throughout the forward pass.",
