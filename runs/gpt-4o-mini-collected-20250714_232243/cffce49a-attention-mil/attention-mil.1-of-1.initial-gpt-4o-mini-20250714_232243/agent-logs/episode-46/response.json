    "state_analysis": "The test continues to fail with the same `RuntimeError`, indicating that the shapes of the tensors involved in the multiplication are still incompatible. The output tensor `z` remains of shape (4), which is not suitable for the `bag_level_classifier`. This suggests that the attention pooling computation is not being done correctly, leading to an unexpected output shape.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, I will ensure that the attention weights `a` are applied correctly to the patch embeddings `h` before calculating `z`. The multiplication must properly reflect the intended weighted sum of the patch embeddings. I will modify the implementation to ensure that the dimensions align correctly and that `z` has the appropriate shape for classification. After making these adjustments, I will run the tests again to verify the functionality.",
