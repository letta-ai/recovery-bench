    "state_analysis": "The repeated `RuntimeError` signifies that the output tensor `z` is still of shape (4) and is not compatible with the input shape required by the `bag_level_classifier`. This suggests that the attention weights and embeddings are not being combined correctly to produce the expected output shape for the classifier.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, I will ensure that the attention weights `a` are properly applied to the patch embeddings `h` and that the resulting tensor `z` has the correct dimensions. The formula for computing `z` from the attention weights and the embeddings needs to ensure that the dimensions align correctly. I will modify the code to ensure proper dimensions during the multiplication step. After making these adjustments, I will run the tests again to verify the functionality.",
