    "state_analysis": "The test continues to fail with the `RuntimeError`, indicating that the shapes of the matrices being multiplied are incompatible. The output tensor `z` remains of shape (4), which is not suitable for the `bag_level_classifier`. This suggests that the attention mechanism is not being applied correctly, leading to an unexpected output shape.",
    "explanation": "To address this, I will ensure that the attention weights `a` are applied correctly to the patch embeddings `h` and that the resulting tensor `z` has the correct dimensions before being passed to the classifier. The attention weights should be broadcasted to match the dimensions of `h`. I will modify the code to ensure proper alignment of the dimensions and run the tests again to verify the implementation.",
