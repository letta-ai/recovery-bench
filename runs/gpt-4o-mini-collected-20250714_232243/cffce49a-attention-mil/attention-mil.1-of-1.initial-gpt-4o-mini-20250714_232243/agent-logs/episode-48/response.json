    "state_analysis": "The test continues to fail with the same `RuntimeError`, indicating that the output tensor `z` is still of shape (4). This shape is incompatible with the input shape that the `bag_level_classifier` expects, suggesting that the application of attention weights to the patch embeddings is still not functioning correctly.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, I will ensure that the attention weights `a` are properly applied to the patch embeddings `h` and that the resulting tensor `z` has the correct dimensions before being passed to the classifier. I will carefully review the computation of `z` to ensure it reflects the correct weighted sum of the embeddings using the attention weights. After making these adjustments, I will run the tests again.",
