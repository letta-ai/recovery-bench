    "state_analysis": "The latest output shows that the shapes of intermediate tensors during the forward pass are being printed correctly, but a `RuntimeError` occurs when trying to perform a matrix multiplication in the final layer of the `ABMIL` model. Specifically, the shapes of the tensors being multiplied do not align (1x4 and 5x2), which indicates that the output `z` from the attention pooling step does not have the correct dimensions to feed into the `bag_level_classifier`.",
    "explanation": "The issue arises from the way the attention pooling is computed. The output `z` should have a shape that matches the expected input shape for the `bag_level_classifier`. Since `z` is currently of shape (4), it needs to be reshaped or adjusted to have the correct dimensions. I will modify the forward pass to ensure that `z` is correctly computed as a tensor with the right dimensions before being passed to the final classifier. After making the necessary changes, I will run the tests again to verify the functionality of the model.",
