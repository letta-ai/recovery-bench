    "state_analysis": "The test is still failing with the same `RuntimeError`, indicating that the output tensor `z` is not being calculated correctly for the expected input shape of the `bag_level_classifier`. The shape of `z` remains (4), which is insufficient for the classifier that expects a different dimensionality.",
    "explanation": "To fix this, I will review the computation of `z` and ensure that the attention weights are being applied correctly. Specifically, the weights should be applied to the patch embeddings before the sum is computed. This means I need to ensure that both `a` and `h` have compatible shapes during multiplication. I will adjust the model's forward method accordingly and rerun the tests.",
