    "state_analysis": "The `RuntimeError` indicates that the output tensor `z` is still of shape (4), which does not match the expected input shape for the `bag_level_classifier`. This suggests that the attention mechanism is not yielding the expected output dimension for the classifier, indicating a persistent issue with how the attention weights are calculated and applied to the embeddings.",
    "explanation": "To fix this, I will ensure that the attention weights are correctly applied to the patch embeddings `h` and that the resulting tensor `z` has the correct dimensions before being passed to the classifier. I will adjust the implementation to ensure that the shapes align correctly during the multiplication and that `z` is computed properly. After these adjustments, I will run the tests again to verify the functionality.",
