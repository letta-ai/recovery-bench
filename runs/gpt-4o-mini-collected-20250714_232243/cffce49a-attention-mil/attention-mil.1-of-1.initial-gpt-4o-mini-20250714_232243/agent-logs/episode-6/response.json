This means that the import statement for `torch` was not included in the test file, leading to the failure. This also indicates that the test file was created successfully using `echo`, but it did not include all necessary imports.",
    "explanation": "To fix this issue, I will add the missing import for the `torch` library in the `test_abmil.py` file. I'll do this using `echo` to append the import statement directly to the file. After that, I will run the tests again to confirm that they execute successfully.",
