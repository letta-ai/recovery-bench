    "state_analysis": "The persistent `RuntimeError` indicates that the output tensor `z` continues to have a shape that is incompatible with the `bag_level_classifier`. This reflects an ongoing issue with how the attention mechanism is being applied to the embeddings, resulting in an incorrect output shape after the attention pooling step.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, I will revisit the computation of the attention weights and ensure that they are applied correctly to the patch embeddings. The expected behavior is that the attention weights should be multiplied with the embeddings, producing a tensor that has the correct dimensions for the classifier. I will modify the code to ensure that the operations correctly yield the desired shape for `z`. After making these adjustments, I will run the tests again.",
