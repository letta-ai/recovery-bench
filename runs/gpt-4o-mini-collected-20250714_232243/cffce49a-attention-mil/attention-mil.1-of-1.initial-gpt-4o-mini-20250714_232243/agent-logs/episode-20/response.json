    "state_analysis": "The `IndentationError` persists due to the incorrect placement or indentation level of the print statement for `bags.shape` in the `test_abmil.py` file. This indicates that the print statement is likely being added in a way that does not align with the rest of the code structure, causing Python to raise an error during the import process.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, I will open the `test_abmil.py` file to manually correct the indentation and ensure that the print statement for `bags.shape` is properly aligned within the `test_forward` method. After making these adjustments, I will run the tests again to verify that everything is functioning correctly.",
