    "state_analysis": "The latest test attempt failed again, but this time it was due to a `NameError` because the variable `h` is not defined in the global scope of the `abmil_assignment.py` file. This suggests that the print statements were incorrectly placed outside of a function or method, causing them to not be executable at the time of import.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, I will remove the print statements from the global scope and ensure that they are included inside the appropriate `forward` methods where `h`, `a`, and `z` are defined. After making these changes, I will run the tests again to check for any shape mismatches and confirm that the model behaves as expected.",
