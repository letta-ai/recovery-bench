    "state_analysis": "The latest test execution failed with an `ImportError`, indicating that the `ABMIL` class could not be imported from the `abmil_assignment.py` file. This suggests that there may be an issue with the definition of the `ABMIL` class or that it might not exist as expected in the file. Additionally, the previous print statements added for debugging have not been executed yet, as the tests did not run successfully.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, I will check the `abmil_assignment.py` file to ensure that the `ABMIL` class is correctly defined and that there are no syntax errors or missing components. After verifying and correcting any issues, I will run the tests again to confirm that the implementation is functioning as intended.",
