    "state_analysis": "The latest error is an `IndentationError`, suggesting that there is inconsistent indentation in the `abmil_assignment.py` file, likely caused by the way the print statements were added. This can prevent the Python interpreter from correctly parsing the file, leading to import failures when running tests.",
    "explanation": "To fix this, I will correct the indentation of the print statements within the `forward` method of the `ABMIL` class. After ensuring consistent indentation, I will run the tests again to verify the functionality of the model and its integration with the test cases.",
