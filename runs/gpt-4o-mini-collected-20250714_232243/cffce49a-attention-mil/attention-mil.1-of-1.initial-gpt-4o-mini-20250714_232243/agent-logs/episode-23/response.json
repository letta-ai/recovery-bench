    "state_analysis": "The test is still failing with a `RuntimeError` regarding incompatible shapes when attempting to multiply matrices in the forward pass of the `ABMIL` model. The output tensor `z` remains of shape (4), which indicates that the attention pooling is not producing the expected output dimension for the final classifier, and thus the reshaping attempt did not address the underlying issue.",
    "explanation": "Upon reviewing the previous logic, it appears that the attention weights `a` are not being properly applied to the patch embeddings `h` to compute `z`. The correct computation should involve a weighted sum of the embeddings using the attention weights. I will adjust the computation of `z` to ensure it aligns with the expected shape for the classifier. After making the necessary changes, I will run the tests again to verify the functionality of the model.",
