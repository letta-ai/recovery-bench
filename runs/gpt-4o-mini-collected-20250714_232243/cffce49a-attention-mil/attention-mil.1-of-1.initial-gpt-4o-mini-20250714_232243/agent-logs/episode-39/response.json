    "state_analysis": "The test continues to fail with the `RuntimeError`, indicating that the shapes of the tensors involved in the multiplication are incompatible. The output tensor `z` is consistently of shape (4), which is not suitable for the `bag_level_classifier`. This indicates that the attention mechanism is not yielding the expected results, leading to an incorrect output shape.",
    "explanation": "To address this, I will ensure that the attention weights `a` are applied correctly to the patch embeddings `h` and that the resulting tensor `z` has the right dimensions before being passed to the classifier. I will modify the computation of `z` to ensure that it reflects the weighted sum of the embeddings using the attention weights. After making these adjustments, I will run the tests again to verify the functionality of the model.",
