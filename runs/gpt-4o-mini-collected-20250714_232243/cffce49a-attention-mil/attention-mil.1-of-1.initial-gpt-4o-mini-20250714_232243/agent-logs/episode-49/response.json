    "state_analysis": "The test continues to fail with the same `RuntimeError`, indicating that the output tensor `z` is still of shape (4) and does not match the expected input shape of the `bag_level_classifier`. This suggests that the implementation of the attention mechanism is still not yielding the expected results, leading to an incorrect output shape.",
    "explanation": "To fix this, I will ensure that the attention weights `a` are applied correctly to the patch embeddings `h` and that the resulting tensor `z` has the correct dimensions before being passed to the classifier. I will modify the computation of `z` to ensure it reflects the weighted sum of the embeddings using the attention weights. After making these adjustments, I will run the tests again to verify the functionality of the model.",
