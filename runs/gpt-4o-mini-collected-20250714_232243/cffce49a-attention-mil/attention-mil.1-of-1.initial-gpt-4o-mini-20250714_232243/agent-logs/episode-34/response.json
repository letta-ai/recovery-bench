    "state_analysis": "The test is still failing with the same `RuntimeError` regarding incompatible shapes during the multiplication of tensors in the `bag_level_classifier`. The output tensor `z` remains of shape (4), which indicates a persistent issue with how the attention weights and embeddings are being combined. The multiplication between the attention weights and the embeddings is not yielding the expected result.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, I will adjust the computation of `z` to ensure that it reflects the weighted sum correctly. The attention weights `a` must be reshaped to match the dimensions of the embeddings `h` before performing the multiplication. I will ensure that the broadcasting is done correctly so that the shapes align properly. After these adjustments, I will run the tests again.",
