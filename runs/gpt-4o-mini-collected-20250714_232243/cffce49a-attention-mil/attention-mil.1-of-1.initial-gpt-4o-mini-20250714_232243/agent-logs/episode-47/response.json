    "state_analysis": "The test continues to fail with the same `RuntimeError`, indicating that the shapes of the tensors involved in the multiplication are still incompatible. The output tensor `z` remains of shape (4) instead of the expected shape for the `bag_level_classifier`, suggesting that the multiplication of the attention weights and embeddings is not yielding the intended result.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, I will ensure that the attention weights `a` are being applied correctly to the patch embeddings `h` and that the resulting tensor `z` has the correct dimensions before being passed to the classifier. I will adjust the implementation to ensure that the shapes align correctly during the multiplication and that `z` is computed properly. After making these adjustments, I will run the tests again to verify the functionality.",
