    "state_analysis": "The test has failed due to a `RuntimeError`, indicating that the shapes of the matrices being multiplied are incompatible. Specifically, the output from the attention pooling step (`z`) does not have the expected shape to be processed by the `bag_level_classifier`. This suggests that there may be an issue with the dimensions of the input data being fed into the model or the way the attention weights are being computed.",
    "explanation": "To address this, I will review the expected input dimensions and ensure that the `ABMIL` model is set up to handle the shape of the input data correctly. I will need to check the dimensions of the input tensor `bags` when it is created in the test case and make sure it matches the expected dimensions in the model's forward pass. I will also print out the shapes of `bags`, `h`, `a`, and `z` to diagnose where the shape mismatch occurs.",
