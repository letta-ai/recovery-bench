    "state_analysis": "The test continues to fail with the same `RuntimeError`, indicating that the shapes of the matrices involved in the multiplication are incompatible. Specifically, the output tensor `z` is still of shape (4) and does not align with the expected shape for the `bag_level_classifier`. This means that the attention pooling calculation is not yielding the expected result, leading to an insufficiently shaped tensor being output from the model.",
    "explanation": "To address this, I will revisit the calculation of the attention weights and their application to the patch embeddings. The attention weights should be applied in a way that allows for proper broadcasting over the patch embeddings to create a vector that matches the expected shape for the classifier. I will ensure that the computations are correctly aligned and then run the tests again to verify the functionality.",
