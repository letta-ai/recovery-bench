    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within this session have failed, it's critical to access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and then restart it. Once the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
