    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and all attempts to stop the Docker service have failed to execute. This indicates a severe issue with the Docker service or the current session within the container. It is critical to manage the Docker service directly from the host system to resolve the issue.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous commands to manage Docker from within the container have failed, I will recommend that you access the host system directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and then restart it before creating a new Docker container for further work on the langcodes module.",
