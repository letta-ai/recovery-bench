This indicates a critical problem with the current shell session or the Docker service itself. No commands are being processed, and it's necessary to take action from the host system to regain control.",
    "explanation": "Given the failure of all attempts to manage Docker from within the container, I will recommend that you access the host system terminal directly to forcibly stop the Docker service. After ensuring that the Docker service is stopped, I will restart it and create a new container for further work on the langcodes module.",
