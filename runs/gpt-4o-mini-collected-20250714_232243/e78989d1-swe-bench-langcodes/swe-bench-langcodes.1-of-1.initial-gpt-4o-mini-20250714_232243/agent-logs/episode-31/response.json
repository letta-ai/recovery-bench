    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still completely unresponsive, with all commands failing to execute. The Docker service management commands time out, indicating a critical issue with either the Docker service or the entire session. The environment is effectively locked, preventing any command execution.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within the current session have failed, it is crucial to access the host terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and then restart it. After confirming that the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
