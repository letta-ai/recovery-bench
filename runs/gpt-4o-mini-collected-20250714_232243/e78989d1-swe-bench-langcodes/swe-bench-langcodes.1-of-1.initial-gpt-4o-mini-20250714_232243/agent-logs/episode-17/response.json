This indicates a severe issue with the Docker container or the session itself. It is critical to manage the Docker service directly from the host system.",
    "explanation": "Since there have been continuous failures to stop the Docker service from within the container, I will recommend that you access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcefully stop the Docker service and check its status before restarting it. After that, I will create a new container for further work on the langcodes module.",
