    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, with repeated failures to execute any commands, particularly those aimed at managing the Docker service. This indicates a critical issue with the Docker environment or the terminal session itself, rendering any command execution impossible.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent state of unresponsiveness, it is crucial to take control from the host system directly. You must open the host system's terminal to forcibly stop the Docker service and restart it. Once the service is operational, I will set up a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
