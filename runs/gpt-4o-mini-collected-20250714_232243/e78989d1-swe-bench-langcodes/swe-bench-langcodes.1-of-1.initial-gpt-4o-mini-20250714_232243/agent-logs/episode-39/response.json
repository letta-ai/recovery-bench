This indicates a critical issue with the Docker service or the session itself, preventing any commands from being executed successfully. The environment is effectively locked, and command execution is impossible.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within this session have failed, it is imperative to access the host terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, verify its status, and then restart it. After ensuring that the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
