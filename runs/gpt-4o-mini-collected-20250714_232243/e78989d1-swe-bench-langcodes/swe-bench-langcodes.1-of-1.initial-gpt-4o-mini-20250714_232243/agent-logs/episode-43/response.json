    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still completely unresponsive, and all commands to manage the Docker service have failed. This indicates a serious issue with either the Docker service or the shell session itself, effectively locking the environment and preventing any command execution.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within the current session have failed, it is crucial to access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and then restart it. After confirming that the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
