    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still completely unresponsive, and all commands aimed at managing the Docker service have failed. This indicates a critical issue with the Docker service or the session itself, preventing any commands from being executed successfully. The environment is effectively locked, and no command execution is possible.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to manage Docker from within the current session have failed, it is essential to access the host terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status to confirm it is down, and then restart it. After ensuring the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
