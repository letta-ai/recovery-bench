    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, and all commands aimed at managing the Docker service have timed out. This indicates a critical issue with the Docker service or the current session itself, effectively locking the environment and preventing any command execution.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within this session have failed, it is essential to access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and restart it. After confirming that the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
