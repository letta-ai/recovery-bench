    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains entirely unresponsive, with repeated failures to execute any commands aimed at managing the Docker service. This situation indicates a critical issue with the Docker service or the shell session itself, locking the environment and preventing any commands from being executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within this session have failed, it is crucial to access the host terminal directly. You should forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and then restart it. After confirming that the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
