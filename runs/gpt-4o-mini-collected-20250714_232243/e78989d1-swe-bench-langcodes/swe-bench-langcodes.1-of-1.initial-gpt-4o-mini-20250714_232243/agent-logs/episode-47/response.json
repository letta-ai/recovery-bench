    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still completely unresponsive, with all commands to manage the Docker service failing to execute. This indicates a critical issue with the Docker service or the current shell session, effectively locking the environment and preventing any command execution. The situation is highly problematic as no commands are being processed successfully.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent failures in executing any commands aimed at managing Docker from within the current session, the next step is to access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, verify its status, and then restart it. Once the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
