    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, and attempts to stop the Docker service have consistently failed. All commands aimed at managing Docker have timed out, indicating a severe issue with either the Docker service or the shell session itself. The environment is effectively locked, and any command execution is unsuccessful.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent failures, the best course of action is to access the host system's terminal directly. You should forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and then restart it. After confirming that the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
