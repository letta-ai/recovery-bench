This indicates a severe issue with the Docker service, the current session, or both. The environment is effectively locked, preventing any command from being executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within the container have failed, the next logical step is to access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, verify its status, and restart it. Once the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
