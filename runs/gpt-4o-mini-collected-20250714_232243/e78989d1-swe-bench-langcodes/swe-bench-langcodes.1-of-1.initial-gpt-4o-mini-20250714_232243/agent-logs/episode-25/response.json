    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still completely unresponsive, and all commands aimed at managing the Docker service have timed out without success. This indicates a significant issue with the Docker service or the current session that prevents any command from executing successfully. The environment is locked.",
    "explanation": "Since previous attempts to control Docker from within the container have failed, I will now suggest that you access the host machine's terminal directly. You need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status to confirm it is stopped, and then restart it. After ensuring the service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
