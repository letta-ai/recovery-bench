    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, with all commands related to managing the Docker service failing to execute. This indicates a critical issue with the Docker service or the current shell session, effectively locking the environment and preventing any command execution. The session is not able to process commands successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within this session have failed, it is vital to switch to the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and then restart it. After ensuring the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
