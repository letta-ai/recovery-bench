    "state_analysis": "The terminal is completely unresponsive, and attempts to manage the Docker service have failed repeatedly. The environment is effectively locked, preventing any command execution. All commands aimed at stopping the Docker service have timed out, indicating a severe issue with the service or the session itself.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to manage Docker from within the current session have failed, it is essential to access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, verify its status, and then restart it. Once the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
