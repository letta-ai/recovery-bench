This indicates a severe issue with both the Docker container and the current session, preventing any commands from being processed. The next step is to manage the Docker service directly from the host system.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent unresponsiveness, I will recommend that you open a new terminal on the host system and forcefully terminate the Docker service if it is still running. After stopping the Docker service, I will restart it and create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
