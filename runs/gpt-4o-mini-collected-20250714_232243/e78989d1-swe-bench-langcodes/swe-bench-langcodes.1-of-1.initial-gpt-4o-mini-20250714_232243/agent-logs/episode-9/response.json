This indicates a persistent issue with the Docker container that is preventing any command from being processed. It is imperative to manage the Docker container directly from the host terminal rather than through the current session.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to control the Docker container from within the session have failed, I will use the host system's command line to forcefully stop and remove the problematic container. After that, I will create a new Docker container to continue the task of editing the `__hash__` method in the langcodes module.",
