    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, with all commands aimed at managing the Docker service failing to execute. This indicates a critical issue with the Docker service or the current session, effectively locking the environment and preventing any command execution.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within the current session have failed, it is essential to switch to the host machine's terminal. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and then restart it. Once the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
