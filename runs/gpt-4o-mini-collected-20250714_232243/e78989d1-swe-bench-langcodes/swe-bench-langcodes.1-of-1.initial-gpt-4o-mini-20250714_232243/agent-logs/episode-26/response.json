    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, with all commands related to managing the Docker service failing to execute successfully. This suggests a critical issue with the Docker service or the current session that prevents any command from being processed. The environment is locked and unresponsive to further commands.",
    "explanation": "Since previous attempts to manage the Docker service from within this session have failed and the environment is unresponsive, the next step is to access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and then restart it. After confirming the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container for further work on the langcodes module.",
