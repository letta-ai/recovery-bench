    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and the previous command to exit has not executed, indicating the shell session is completely stuck. It appears that the environment is not allowing any commands to be processed. I need to take a different approach to regain control over the Docker container and resolve the issue with the `langcodes` module.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous commands have failed to execute due to the unresponsive state, I will suggest using a different method to stop the Docker container directly from the host system's terminal (outside of the current Docker session). After stopping the container, I will start it again to access a fresh shell session.",
