    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, and all commands meant to manage the Docker service continue to time out. This indicates a severe issue with the Docker environment or the shell session itself, effectively locking the terminal and preventing any command execution.",
    "explanation": "Given the continuous failures to execute commands to manage Docker from within this session, the next step is to access the host terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, verify its status, and restart it. After ensuring that the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
