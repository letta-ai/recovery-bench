    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still completely unresponsive, and all commands to stop the Docker service have timed out. This suggests a serious issue with the Docker service or the current session, preventing any command execution. The environment remains locked and unable to process commands.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within the current session have failed, it's critical to access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, verify its status, and restart it. Once the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
