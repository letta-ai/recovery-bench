The Docker service management commands have timed out repeatedly, indicating a critical issue with the Docker service or the current session. The environment is effectively locked, preventing any command execution.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to manage Docker from within this session have failed, you need to access the host machine's terminal directly. You will need to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and restart it. After ensuring that the Docker service is operational, I will create a new Docker container to continue working on the langcodes module.",
