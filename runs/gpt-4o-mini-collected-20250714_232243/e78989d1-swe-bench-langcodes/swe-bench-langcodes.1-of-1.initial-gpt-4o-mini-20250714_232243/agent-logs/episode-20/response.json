    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, and all commands related to managing the Docker service have timed out. This indicates a critical issue with the Docker container or the current shell session. No commands are being processed successfully, and all previous attempts to manage the Docker service have failed.",
    "explanation": "Given the nature of the persistent unresponsiveness, it is necessary to take control from the host system directly. I will recommend that you access the host terminal to forcibly stop the Docker service, check its status, and restart it. Once the service is operational, I will create a new Docker container for further work on the langcodes module.",
