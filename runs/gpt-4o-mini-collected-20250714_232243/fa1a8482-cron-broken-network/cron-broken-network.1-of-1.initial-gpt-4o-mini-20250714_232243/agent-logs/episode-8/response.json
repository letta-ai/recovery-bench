    "state_analysis": "The /etc/hosts file appears to be correctly configured, with localhost and the container's own IP address listed. However, both the curl command directed at example.com and the command using the direct IP address of example.com (93.184.216.34) are returning a DNS resolution error. This indicates that curl is not functioning correctly even with a direct IP address, suggesting that the issue may be with the curl installation itself or a broader network configuration problem.",
