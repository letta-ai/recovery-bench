    "state_analysis": "Attempts to access example.com and its IP address (93.184.216.34) via curl are still returning a DNS resolution error, which suggests that the curl tool itself cannot establish any connections, possibly due to a broader network issue or restrictions in the container's environment.",
    "explanation": "Since DNS resolution and direct IP access through curl are both failing, I will check the container's network settings by inspecting the default route using the `route` command, if available, or by trying to access the network interface configuration. This can provide insights into the network connectivity of the container.",
