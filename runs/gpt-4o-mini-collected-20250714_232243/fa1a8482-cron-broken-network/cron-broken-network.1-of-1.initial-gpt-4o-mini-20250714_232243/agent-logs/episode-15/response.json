This indicates that the issue is likely not isolated to the DNS resolver settings, as the container is unable to resolve any external domains using curl.",
    "explanation": "I will attempt to directly access a known IP address using curl to see if the problem is isolated to DNS resolution or if there is a broader networking issue. I will use the IP address of example.com (93.184.216.34) directly with curl to check for connectivity.",
