    "state_analysis": "The curl command is unable to connect to both example.com and the Google DNS server (8.8.8.8), which indicates a broader networking issue within the Docker container. The routing table shows that the container has a default gateway set, but it is not able to resolve any addresses or connect to them, indicating that the network configuration is likely malformed.",
    "explanation": "Since the internal DNS resolver and direct IP connections are both failing, I will reset the Docker container's network settings. This may involve restarting the Docker service or recreating the network settings via Docker commands. However, I cannot execute Docker commands from within the container itself. Instead, I will exit the container and use the Docker host to inspect and reset the networking settings for this container.",
