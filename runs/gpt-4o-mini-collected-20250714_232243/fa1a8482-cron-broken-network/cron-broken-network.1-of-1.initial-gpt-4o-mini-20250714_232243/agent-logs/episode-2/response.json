    "state_analysis": "The /etc/resolv.conf file indicates that the Docker container is configured to use an internal DNS resolver (127.0.0.11). However, the failure to ping a public IP (8.8.8.8) indicates that networking tools like ping are not available in this container, possibly due to a minimal base image. This suggests that while there is an issue with DNS resolution, I cannot verify connectivity to external networks since ping is not installed.",
    "explanation": "I will try to install the ping utility (iputils-ping) to verify connectivity. Additionally, I'll check if other networking tools are available or if I need to install a package manager to add these utilities.",
