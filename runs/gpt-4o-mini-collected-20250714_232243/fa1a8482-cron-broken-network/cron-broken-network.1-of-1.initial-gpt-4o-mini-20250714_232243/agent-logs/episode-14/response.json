    "state_analysis": "Attempts to use `nslookup`, `dig`, and `iptables` failed because these commands are not available in this minimal Docker environment. The continuous DNS resolution error from curl indicates that the DNS configuration is fundamentally flawed, and no standard tools are available to diagnose the issue directly.",
    "explanation": "As an alternative, I will try to manually append a different DNS server (like 1.1.1.1 from Cloudflare) to the /etc/resolv.conf file and check if that resolves the issue. This might help in bypassing any DNS issues caused by the previous configurations.",
