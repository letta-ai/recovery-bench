    "explanation": "I will manually edit the script to ensure that the flow initialization and the conditional statement are written correctly. Specifically, I will ensure that the list initialization is on its own line, followed by the conditional statement. After making these corrections, I will run the script again to process the .pcap file and generate the NetFlow v5 files.",
