The `SyntaxWarning` regarding the invalid escape sequence in the file path also continues to appear, indicating that the f-string needs to be corrected.",
    "explanation": "I will correct the indentation for the block of code that follows the `if` statement to ensure it is properly formatted. Additionally, I will resolve the escape sequence issue in the file naming for saving the NetFlow output files by ensuring the backslash is correctly escaped. After making these adjustments, I will run the script again to process the .pcap file and generate the NetFlow v5 files.",
