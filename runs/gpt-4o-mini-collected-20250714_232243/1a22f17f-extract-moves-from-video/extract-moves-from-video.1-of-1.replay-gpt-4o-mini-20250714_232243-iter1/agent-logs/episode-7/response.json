    "state_analysis": "The video was successfully downloaded using yt-dlp, and it appears to have been merged into 'video.mp4.mkv'. However, the ffmpeg command is still failing because it is trying to access 'video.mp4', which is not the correct file name; the downloaded file is 'video.mp4.mkv'. Thus, ffmpeg is unable to find the input file, leading to the error.",
