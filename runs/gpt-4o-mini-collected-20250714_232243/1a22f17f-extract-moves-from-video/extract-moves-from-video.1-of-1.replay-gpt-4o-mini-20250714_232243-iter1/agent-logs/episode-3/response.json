Consequently, the video file 'video.mp4' has not been downloaded, leading to further failures when trying to use ffmpeg for subtitle extraction. The system indicates that additional permissions or configurations may be needed to successfully install packages.",
    "explanation": "I will attempt to install youtube-dl using pipx, which manages a virtual environment for Python applications. This may help bypass the issues encountered previously. After installing youtube-dl, I will download the video and proceed with extracting the subtitles.",
