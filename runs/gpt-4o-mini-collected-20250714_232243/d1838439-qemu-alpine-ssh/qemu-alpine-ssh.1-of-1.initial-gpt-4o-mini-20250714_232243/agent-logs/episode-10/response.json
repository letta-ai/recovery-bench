    "state_analysis": "The Alpine Linux environment is continuously booting to the login prompt, but all attempts to log in as root have failed consistently. The inability to log in suggests that the setup may be encountering issues with either the Alpine ISO or the boot settings.",
    "explanation": "Since we are unable to log in, we might need to try a different approach by using a different Alpine Linux version or a different method to access the system. One option is to try using a live USB or ISO that provides more straightforward access to root or a recovery mode. Another option is to check if the ISO is corrupted or if there are alternative boot parameters that could be used to bypass the login issue.",
