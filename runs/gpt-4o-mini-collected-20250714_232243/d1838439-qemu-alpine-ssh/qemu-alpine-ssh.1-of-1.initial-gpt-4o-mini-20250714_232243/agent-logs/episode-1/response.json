As a result, the Alpine Linux environment did not start successfully, which means that commands related to SSH installation and service management are not executable because they depend on a running Alpine instance.",
    "explanation": "We need to run the QEMU command with a different option to avoid graphical output, using a virtual frame buffer instead. This will allow the Alpine Linux instance to boot without requiring a GUI. After booting, we will then install OpenSSH and start the SSH server.",
