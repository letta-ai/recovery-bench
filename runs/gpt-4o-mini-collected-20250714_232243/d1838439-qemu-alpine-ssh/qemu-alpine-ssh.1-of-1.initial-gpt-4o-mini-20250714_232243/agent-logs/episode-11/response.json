The previous commands to access the shell directly have not been successful, indicating potential issues with the ISO or the method used to boot.",
    "explanation": "Since we are unable to log in through the standard root access method, we should try a different strategy. We can attempt to use a different boot parameter that may allow us to access a recovery console or directly to the shell without requiring a login. This will help us troubleshoot the issue further.",
