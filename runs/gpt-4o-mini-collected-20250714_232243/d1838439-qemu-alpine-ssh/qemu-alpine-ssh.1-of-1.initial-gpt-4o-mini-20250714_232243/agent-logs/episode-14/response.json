    "state_analysis": "The terminal indicates a failure related to OCI runtime, suggesting that the command to start the QEMU instance did not execute correctly due to issues with the container environment. This may indicate a problem with the setup or the configuration of the Alpine ISO.",
    "explanation": "Since the attempts to boot into the Alpine Linux environment have failed consistently, we may need to consider other options. This includes verifying the integrity of the ISO file, switching to a different version of Alpine Linux, or using an alternative method to run the Alpine environment. We will try to start QEMU again without the additional parameters to see if we can access the installation normally.",
