    "explanation": "Since we are repeatedly facing login issues, it may be worth considering that the Alpine ISO could be corrupted or not functioning as expected. We could also try using a different version of the Alpine Linux ISO or a different approach to booting. Alternatively, we can verify if there are any other boot options available that may lead us into a recovery or shell mode without the login requirement.",
