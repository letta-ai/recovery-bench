This ongoing problem has led to multiple exits and reattempts without success.",
    "explanation": "To address the issues effectively, I will provide a fresh series of commands to correctly create the Python script that calculates the maximum number of consecutive days without flights. This will involve carefully constructing the script without introducing any syntax errors, ensuring that it can be executed successfully in the container environment. After creating the script, I will run it to generate the output in 'results.txt'.",
