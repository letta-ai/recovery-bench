    "state_analysis": "The continuous failures to generate valid keys for the `decrypt` function indicate that the methods used to extract and format the keys from the `pairs.txt` file have not been successful. The error messages consistently indicate that the keys generated do not conform to the required 20-bit hexadecimal format. The persistent issues with syntax and formatting suggest a need for a reevaluation of the strategy for deriving the keys. The current methods have not yielded usable results, resulting in ongoing failures when attempting to decrypt.",
    "explanation": "To resolve the ongoing issues, we will change our approach to ensure that we derive four valid keys based on a recognizable pattern or selection from the pairs. Instead of relying on previous methods, we will extract specific values from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. This will ensure that we generate exactly four valid keys that meet the requirements of the decrypt function, ensuring they are formatted correctly. We will explicitly define how we derive the necessary key values.",
