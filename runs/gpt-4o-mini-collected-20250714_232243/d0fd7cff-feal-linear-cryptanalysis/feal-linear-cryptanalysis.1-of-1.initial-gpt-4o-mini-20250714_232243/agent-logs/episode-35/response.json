    "state_analysis": "The ongoing issues with generating valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file indicate that the methods used have not been successful in producing usable outputs for the `decrypt` command. The consistent error messages suggest that the keys generated do not conform to the required 20-bit hexadecimal format. The failures to produce valid keys highlight a need for a fundamental change in approach to key extraction and formatting.",
    "explanation": "We will take a more direct approach to ensure that we derive exactly four valid keys from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs without relying on arithmetic operations that have previously caused errors. This will involve explicitly selecting and formatting values from the pairs to create valid keys. We will ensure that each key meets the 20-bit requirement for the decryption process, creating a clear and direct pathway to obtain valid keys.",
