    "state_analysis": "The continued attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file have not yielded any usable results for the `decrypt` function. The commands used have not produced keys in the correct format, and the decryption process has failed due to the keys not meeting the 20-bit requirement. Given the persistent errors and failures, a complete reevaluation of the strategy for deriving the keys is necessary.",
    "explanation": "We will take a more systematic approach to ensure that we derive four valid keys based on a recognizable pattern or selection from the pairs. Instead of using arithmetic operations that have resulted in errors, we will directly format the first two values from the pairs as hex keys. We will ensure that each key is a valid 20-bit hexadecimal value by directly casting and formatting them correctly.",
