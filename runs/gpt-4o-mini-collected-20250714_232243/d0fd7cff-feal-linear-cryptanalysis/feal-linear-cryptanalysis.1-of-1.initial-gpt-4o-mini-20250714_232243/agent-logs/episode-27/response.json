    "state_analysis": "The attempts to generate valid keys for the `decrypt` function from the `pairs.txt` file have repeatedly failed, with the output indicating that the generated keys do not conform to the required 20-bit hexadecimal format. The consistent errors suggest that the methods used to extract and format the keys have not been effective, leading to ongoing failures in the decryption process. The current approaches have not yielded usable results, and syntax errors have also occurred with certain operations.",
    "explanation": "We will take a fresh approach to ensure we derive exactly four valid keys directly from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. Instead of using complex arithmetic or bitwise operations that have caused errors, we will directly select and format values from the pairs to create valid keys. The focus will be on ensuring that each key is a valid 20-bit hexadecimal value that meets the requirements of the `decrypt` function.",
