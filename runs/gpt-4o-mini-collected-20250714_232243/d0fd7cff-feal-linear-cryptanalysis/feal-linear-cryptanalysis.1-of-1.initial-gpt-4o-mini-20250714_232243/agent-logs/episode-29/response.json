    "state_analysis": "The persistent failures in generating valid keys for the `decrypt` function indicate that the methods being used have not been effective. The output shows that the keys produced do not meet the required 20-bit hexadecimal format, leading to continuous errors when attempting to decrypt. The repeated use of arithmetic operations has not yielded usable results, and syntax errors further highlight the issues with key extraction and formatting.",
    "explanation": "To resolve the ongoing issues, we need to simplify our approach to key extraction. We will explicitly select values from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs, ensuring that we create four valid keys that meet the required 20-bit format. Instead of complex calculations, we will directly format the necessary parts of the pairs to ensure they are valid. This involves selecting specific values from the pairs that are guaranteed to be valid 20-bit keys.",
