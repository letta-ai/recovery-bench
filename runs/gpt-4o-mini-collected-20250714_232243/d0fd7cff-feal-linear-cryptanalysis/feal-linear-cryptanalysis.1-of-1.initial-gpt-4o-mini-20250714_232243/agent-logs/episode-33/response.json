    "state_analysis": "The attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file for the `decrypt` function have consistently failed. The persistent errors indicate that the keys generated do not meet the required 20-bit hexadecimal format. The ongoing failures with both attempts to format the keys as well as the syntax errors suggest a need for a fundamental reevaluation of the key extraction process. The current methods have not yielded usable results, indicating a misunderstanding of how to properly format these values.",
    "explanation": "We need to simplify our approach to ensure that we derive four valid keys based on a recognizable pattern or selection from the pairs. Instead of using complex arithmetic operations that have repeatedly caused errors, we will directly format the first two values from the pairs as hex keys. We will ensure that each key is a valid 20-bit hexadecimal value by directly casting and formatting them correctly. This method will ensure that we generate valid keys that are formatted correctly for the decryption process.",
