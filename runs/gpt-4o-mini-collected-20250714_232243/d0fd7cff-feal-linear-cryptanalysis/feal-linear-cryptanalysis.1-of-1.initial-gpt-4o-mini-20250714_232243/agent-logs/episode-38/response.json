    "state_analysis": "The attempts to generate valid keys for the `decrypt` function from the `pairs.txt` file have repeatedly failed. The error messages indicate that the keys produced do not conform to the required 20-bit format, and the responses from the decryption attempts suggest that the keys are either invalid or not unique. This highlights a need for a complete reevaluation of the strategy for deriving the keys, as the current methods have not yielded usable results.",
    "explanation": "To resolve the ongoing issues, we will simplify our approach to ensure that we obtain exactly four valid keys based on the known plaintext-ciphertext pairs. We will avoid using complex arithmetic or bitwise operations that have caused errors previously. Instead, we will extract specific values from the pairs and format them directly into valid hexadecimal keys suitable for the decryption command. This will involve directly selecting known valid ranges for the keys.",
