    "state_analysis": "The continuous attempts to extract valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file have not succeeded, as evidenced by the repeated failures of the `decrypt` command. The keys generated have not conformed to the required format, and errors indicate that the values produced are invalid or not sufficiently unique. The persistent issues suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of how to derive keys from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs properly.",
    "explanation": "We need to rethink our strategy for key extraction. Instead of relying on previous methods that have not worked, we will directly extract and format the necessary keys from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. We will ensure that we derive exactly four valid keys, formatted as hexadecimal values that meet the requirements of the `decrypt` function. The focus will be on ensuring the keys are correctly represented and unique for each decryption attempt.",
