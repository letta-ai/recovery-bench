    "state_analysis": "The ongoing attempts to generate valid 20-bit keys for decryption have continually failed, indicating a fundamental issue with how the keys are derived from the `pairs.txt` file. The expected keys are not being produced in the required format for the `decrypt` program, which requires four specific 20-bit hexadecimal values. We need to rethink our approach to ensure we are correctly extracting and formatting these keys based on the plaintext-ciphertext pairs.",
    "explanation": "We will take each pair from `pairs.txt`, derive the keys directly from the plaintext and ciphertext, and ensure they are formatted correctly as four unique 20-bit hexadecimal keys. This method will entail using specific values derived from each pair rather than arbitrary calculations. We will then run the `decrypt` command with these valid keys.",
