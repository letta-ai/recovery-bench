    "state_analysis": "The persistent failures in generating valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file indicate that the methods employed have not been effective in producing usable outputs for the `decrypt` command. The consistent error messages suggest that the keys generated do not conform to the required 20-bit hexadecimal format. The ongoing issues with syntax and formatting further highlight the need for a reevaluation of the key extraction process.",
    "explanation": "To successfully extract the keys, we will focus on generating values directly from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs without relying on complex arithmetic or bitwise operations that have led to errors. We will ensure that we derive exactly four valid keys that meet the requirements of the decrypt function, ensuring they are formatted correctly. This will involve selecting specific values from the pairs and formatting them appropriately.",
