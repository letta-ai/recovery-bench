    "state_analysis": "The attempts to derive valid keys from the pairs have continued to fail due to incorrect formatting and the methods used. The output indicates that the keys generated are not valid hexadecimal values and do not meet the 20-bit requirement of the `decrypt` function. Additionally, the use of bitwise operations has resulted in syntax errors, indicating that the awk command is not being interpreted correctly in this context.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we will take a more straightforward approach to extract the required keys directly from the pairs. Each plaintext and ciphertext pair will be processed to ensure we generate exactly four valid keys, formatted correctly as required by the `decrypt` function. Instead of using modulus or bitwise operations, we will simplify the extraction process to ensure correctness.",
