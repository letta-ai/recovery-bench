    "state_analysis": "The attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file have consistently failed, with errors indicating that the keys produced are not in the expected format or not valid 20-bit values. The repeated failures with both modulus and bitwise operations suggest that the methodology for extracting and formatting the keys must be revised. The current approach has not yielded usable results for the `decrypt` function.",
    "explanation": "We will take a different approach by explicitly defining how to extract the keys from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. Each entry will be processed to ensure the output is exactly four valid 20-bit hexadecimal values. We will avoid the pitfalls of previous methods by directly assigning the values based on the specific constraints of the problem. This method will focus on ensuring each key is correctly formatted as required by the decrypt command.",
