    "state_analysis": "The repeated attempts to generate and format valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file have not succeeded in producing the required 20-bit hexadecimal values for the `decrypt` function. The issues seem to stem from the fact that the calculations and formats used have not aligned with the specific requirements of the decryption program, which needs four distinct 20-bit keys. The keys derived so far have not met the expected criteria, leading to persistent errors during decryption.",
    "explanation": "We will derive the keys differently by extracting specific key patterns or values from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs instead of using modulus operations or relying on the current formats. This will involve modifying our approach to ensure we get exactly four appropriate keys for the decryption process from the `pairs.txt` file. We will create a script to derive keys based on the required format directly from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs.",
