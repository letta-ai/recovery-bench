    "state_analysis": "The previous attempts to generate valid 20-bit keys from the `pairs.txt` file have not succeeded. The errors indicate that the values produced by the commands are not in the expected format required by the `decrypt` function. The consistent use of modulus operations and bitwise operations has not yielded the correct set of keys necessary for decryption, leading to persistent failures.",
    "explanation": "We need to change our approach to directly extract keys from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs in a manner that guarantees they will be valid 20-bit hexadecimal values. We will create exactly four keys per line based on the plaintext or ciphertext values, ensuring they conform to the 20-bit requirement. This method will involve using specific selections from the pairs instead of relying on modulus or bitwise operations.",
