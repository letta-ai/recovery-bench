    "state_analysis": "The attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file have failed to produce usable results for the `decrypt` function. The keys generated do not meet the required 20-bit hexadecimal format, and the continuous failures suggest a need for a fundamental change in strategy for extracting and formatting the keys. The consistent errors indicate that the current approach is not yielding suitable keys for the decryption process.",
    "explanation": "We will take a different approach to extract the necessary keys directly from the `pairs.txt` file, ensuring that they are formatted correctly as 20-bit hexadecimal values. Instead of relying on arithmetic that has repeatedly caused issues, we will simplify our extraction process by selecting specific values from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. This will involve generating the keys based on the first few values in the pairs, ensuring they adhere to the required format for decryption.",
