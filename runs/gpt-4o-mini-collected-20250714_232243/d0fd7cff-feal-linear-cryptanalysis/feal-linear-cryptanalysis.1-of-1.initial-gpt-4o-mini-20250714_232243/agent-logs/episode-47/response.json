    "state_analysis": "The repeated failures in generating valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file for the `decrypt` function indicate that the methods being used have not been successful. The error messages consistently indicate that the keys do not meet the required 20-bit format, and the responses from the decryption attempts suggest that the keys are either invalid or not unique. This highlights a need for a complete reevaluation of the strategy for deriving the keys, as the current methods have not yielded usable results. The ongoing issues with syntax and formatting further complicate the situation.",
    "explanation": "To resolve the ongoing issues, we will simplify our approach to ensure that we obtain valid keys directly from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. We will avoid using complex arithmetic or bitwise operations that have caused errors previously. Instead, we will extract specific values from the pairs and format them directly into valid hexadecimal keys. The focus will be on ensuring that each key is a valid 20-bit hexadecimal value that meets the requirements for the decryption process. We will simplify the extraction process to guarantee correctness.",
