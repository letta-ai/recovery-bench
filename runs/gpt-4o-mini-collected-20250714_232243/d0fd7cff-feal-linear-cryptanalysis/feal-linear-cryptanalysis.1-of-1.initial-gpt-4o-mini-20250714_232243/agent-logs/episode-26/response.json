    "state_analysis": "The ongoing failures to generate valid keys for the `decrypt` function indicate that the methods used to format the keys from the `pairs.txt` file have not been successful. The consistent errors suggest that the keys generated are not unique or formatted correctly, and the repeated syntax errors imply a misunderstanding of how to manipulate the values correctly using the tools at hand.",
    "explanation": "We will reevaluate the strategy used to derive the keys. Instead of relying on arithmetic that has repeatedly led to errors, we will focus on extracting the necessary values from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs directly. We will define specific key values based on known valid ranges and ensure that they fit within the 20-bit limit required for the decryption. This will involve selecting values from the pairs and formatting them correctly as hexadecimal values.",
