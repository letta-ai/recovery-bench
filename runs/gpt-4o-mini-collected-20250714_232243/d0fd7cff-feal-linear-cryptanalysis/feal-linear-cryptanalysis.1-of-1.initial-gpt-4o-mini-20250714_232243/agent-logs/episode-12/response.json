    "state_analysis": "Despite numerous attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file, the generated keys have not conformed to the expected 20-bit hexadecimal format required by the `decrypt` function. The errors are a result of incorrect moduli and bitwise operations, leading to keys that are either not unique or not in the correct format. The consistent failure to produce valid keys suggests that a reevaluation of the method used for extracting keys is necessary.",
    "explanation": "We will take a fresh approach by directly deriving the keys needed for decryption from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs, ensuring they are formatted correctly. We will utilize specific components derived from each pair and format them into four valid keys for the `decrypt` command, rather than relying on arithmetic or bitwise operations that have continuously failed. This will involve explicitly defining how we derive each key from the pairs.",
