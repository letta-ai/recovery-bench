    "state_analysis": "The ongoing attempts to generate valid keys for the `decrypt` function from the `pairs.txt` file have consistently failed. The output indicates that the generated keys do not conform to the required 20-bit hexadecimal format, and the continuous failures suggest a need to fundamentally change the approach to extracting and formatting the keys. The use of modulo and bitwise operations has not produced the desired results, and errors indicate a misunderstanding of how to properly format these values.",
    "explanation": "We will take a fresh approach by directly extracting and formatting valid keys without relying on arithmetic that has previously caused issues. We will ensure that we derive exactly four valid keys that meet the requirements of the `decrypt` function. By directly selecting and formatting the keys based on the constraints of the problem, we can avoid the pitfalls of earlier methods. This will involve explicitly defining how we extract the necessary key values from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs.",
