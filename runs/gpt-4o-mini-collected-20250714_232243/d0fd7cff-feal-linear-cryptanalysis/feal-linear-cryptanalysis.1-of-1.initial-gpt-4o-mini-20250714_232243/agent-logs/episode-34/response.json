    "state_analysis": "The ongoing attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file have not yielded usable results for the `decrypt` function. The consistent error messages indicate that the generated keys do not conform to the required 20-bit hexadecimal format. The repeated failures suggest that the methods employed have not been effective in producing usable keys for decryption. The syntax errors observed with certain operations further indicate a misunderstanding of how to manipulate the values correctly using the tools at hand.",
    "explanation": "We need to shift our strategy to derive four valid keys directly from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs without relying on complex arithmetic or bitwise operations. Instead, we will focus on extracting the pairs' values directly and formatting them correctly as hexadecimal keys. The goal is to ensure that each key meets the 20-bit requirement for the decryption process, creating a clear and direct pathway to obtain valid keys.",
