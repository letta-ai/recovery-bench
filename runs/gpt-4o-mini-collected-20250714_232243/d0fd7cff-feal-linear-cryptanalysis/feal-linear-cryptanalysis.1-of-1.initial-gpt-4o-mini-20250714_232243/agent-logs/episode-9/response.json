    "state_analysis": "The attempts to retrieve and format keys from the `pairs.txt` file have consistently failed to yield the correct 20-bit hexadecimal values required for the `decrypt` function. The output indicates that the key formatting is incorrect, and the program is unable to process the keys as expected. The consistent use of modulus operations is not producing valid keys for decryption, and attempts to use bitwise operations have resulted in syntax errors.",
    "explanation": "We will change our strategy to manually specify how we generate the four required keys, based on the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. Instead of trying to derive keys from the large numbers directly, we will extract specific bits or use fixed values for the keys to ensure they conform to the requirements of the `decrypt` function. This will involve a clearer approach to selecting the keys from the pairs.",
