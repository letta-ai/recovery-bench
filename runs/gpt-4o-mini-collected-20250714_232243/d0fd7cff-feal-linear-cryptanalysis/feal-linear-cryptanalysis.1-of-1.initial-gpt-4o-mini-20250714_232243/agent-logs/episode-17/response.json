    "state_analysis": "Despite multiple attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file, the output remains in the incorrect format, leading to continued failures with the `decrypt` command. The errors indicate that the keys generated do not conform to the required 20-bit hexadecimal format, and the repeated failures suggest a need for a fundamental change in approach to ensure the extraction and formatting of keys is correct.",
    "explanation": "We will take a different approach by explicitly specifying how we derive the four necessary keys from the pairs, ensuring their validity. This will involve directly assigning the necessary values based on the constraints of the problem, avoiding the pitfalls of previous methods. We will extract the first and second value from the pairs and ensure they are properly formatted as hexadecimal keys.",
