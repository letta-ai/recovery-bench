    "state_analysis": "The repeated failures in generating valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file indicate that the methods being used have not been successful. The error messages indicate that the keys do not conform to the required 20-bit format for the `decrypt` function. The ongoing issues suggest that the current arithmetic operations or formatting methods are not effectively producing the required outputs. There is a clear need for a complete reevaluation of the strategy for deriving the keys, as the current methods have not yielded usable results.",
    "explanation": "We need to simplify our approach to key generation by directly extracting and formatting values from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. We will ensure that we derive four valid keys that meet the requirements of the decrypt function, ensuring they are formatted correctly. This will involve selecting specific values from the pairs and formatting them appropriately. The focus is on ensuring that the keys are valid 20-bit hexadecimal values for successful decryption.",
