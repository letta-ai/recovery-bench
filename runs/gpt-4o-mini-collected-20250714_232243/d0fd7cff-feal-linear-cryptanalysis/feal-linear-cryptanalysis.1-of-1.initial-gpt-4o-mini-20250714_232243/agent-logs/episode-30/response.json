    "state_analysis": "The attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file have consistently failed, with persistent errors indicating that the keys produced do not conform to the required 20-bit hexadecimal format. The repeated failures suggest that the methods being utilized have not been effective in creating usable keys for the `decrypt` function. The ongoing issues with syntax and formatting further highlight the need for a reevaluation of the key extraction process.",
    "explanation": "We need to fundamentally change our approach to deriving the keys. Instead of relying on previous methods that have not worked, we will directly extract valid keys from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. We will ensure that we create exactly four valid keys that meet the required 20-bit format without complex calculations that have caused errors previously. This will involve simplifying the extraction process and focusing on the necessary formatting.",
