    "state_analysis": "The necessary files have been verified and compiled successfully. The `feal` program requires specific command-line arguments: plaintext in hexadecimal format along with four 20-bit keys. The `decrypt` program has similar requirements. Since the `key.txt` file generated from the `feal` command does not contain the keys in the expected format, we need to modify our approach to derive the keys correctly from the `pairs.txt` file before proceeding to decryption.",
    "explanation": "The commands will involve modifying the `feal` command to run for each plaintext-ciphertext pair from `pairs.txt`, extracting the keys, and then formatting them correctly into `key.txt`. We will then attempt to decrypt using these keys.",
