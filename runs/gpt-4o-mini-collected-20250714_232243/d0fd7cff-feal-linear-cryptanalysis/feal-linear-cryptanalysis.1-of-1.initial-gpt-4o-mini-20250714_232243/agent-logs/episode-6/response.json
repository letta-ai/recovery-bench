    "state_analysis": "Repeated attempts to generate keys from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs have consistently failed to produce valid 20-bit keys for the `decrypt` program. The methods employed are still not yielding the correct number of keys or the format expected by the decryption function, which requires exactly four 20-bit hexadecimal values. The output suggests that the keys generated are not valid or not sufficient.",
    "explanation": "We will need to analyze the pairs again and extract the keys differently, ensuring that we derive exactly four valid 20-bit keys for each plaintext-ciphertext pair. This time, I will focus on extracting keys directly from a known plaintext-ciphertext mapping instead of trying to derive them from the integer values. Let's extract specific keys directly from the `pairs.txt` file while ensuring they conform to the 20-bit requirement.",
