    "state_analysis": "The attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file have not resulted in usable output for the `decrypt` command. The consistent errors indicate that the keys generated do not meet the required 20-bit hexadecimal format. The repeated failures suggest that the current methods of extraction and formatting have not been effective, and the continual syntax errors further indicate a misunderstanding of how to properly derive the keys.",
    "explanation": "We will change our strategy to ensure we derive four valid keys directly from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs. This time, we will extract specific bits from the pairs to create valid keys without relying on complex arithmetic or bitwise operations. We will ensure that we format the keys correctly as 20-bit hexadecimal values, ready for the `decrypt` function.",
