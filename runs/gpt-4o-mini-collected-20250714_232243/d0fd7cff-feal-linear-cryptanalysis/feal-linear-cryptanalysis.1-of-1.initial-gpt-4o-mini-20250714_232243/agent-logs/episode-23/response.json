    "state_analysis": "The attempts to generate keys for the `decrypt` function have consistently failed, as evidenced by the repeated error messages indicating invalid key formats. The commands executed have not produced keys in the required 20-bit hexadecimal format, and the persistent failures suggest that a new strategy for extracting and formatting the keys is necessary. The current methods of using arithmetic operations have not yielded valid results, and syntax errors have also occurred.",
    "explanation": "We will change our approach to ensure we derive exactly four valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file. Instead of relying on previous methods, we will extract and format the necessary keys directly from the plaintext-ciphertext pairs, ensuring they are correctly represented as valid hexadecimal values that meet the requirements of the `decrypt` command. This will involve using straightforward selections from the pairs without complex calculations that have caused errors.",
