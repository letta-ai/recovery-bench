    "state_analysis": "The attempts to generate valid keys from the `pairs.txt` file have not resulted in usable outputs for the `decrypt` function. The consistent errors indicate that the generated keys do not meet the required 20-bit hexadecimal format. The repeated failures suggest that the methods being used to extract and format the keys have not been effective, leading to ongoing issues in the decryption process. The current approaches have not yielded usable results, and syntax errors have also occurred with certain operations.",
    "explanation": "We need to take a more systematic approach to ensure that we derive four valid keys based on a recognizable pattern or selection from the pairs. Instead of using arithmetic operations that have repeatedly caused errors, we will directly format the first two values from the pairs as hex keys. We will ensure that each key is a valid 20-bit hexadecimal value by directly casting and formatting them correctly. This method will ensure that we generate valid keys that are formatted correctly for the decryption process.",
