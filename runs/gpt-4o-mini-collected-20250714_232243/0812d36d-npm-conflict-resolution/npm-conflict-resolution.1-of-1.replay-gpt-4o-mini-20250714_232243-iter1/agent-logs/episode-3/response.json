The package.json file is still being edited, and we have not yet saved the changes. The dependencies for react and related packages are still in conflict and need to be downgraded before running the installation again.",
    "explanation": "We need to downgrade the react-related packages to resolve conflicts, specifically changing `react` to `16.14.0` and `react-dom` to `16.14.0`. After making these changes, we will save the file and attempt to run the npm install command again to install the dependencies.",
