Determine the next set of commands needed to make progress\n3. Decide if you need to see the output of these commands before proceeding\n\nInstruction:\nSet up a secure Jupyter Notebook server with the following requirements:\n\n1. Install Jupyter Notebook with the necessary dependencies\n2. Configure the server to:\n   - Run on port 8888\n   - Accept connections from any IP address\n   - Use password authentication (set password to \"benchmarkpass\")\n   - Generate a self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS\n3. Create a sample notebook named \"test_notebook.ipynb\" in the current directory with:\n   - A markdown cell explaining what Jupyter Notebook is\n   - A code cell that defines and plots a simple sine wave using matplotlib\n4. Start the Jupyter server in the background so it's running when tests execute. You should allow Jupyter to run as root.\n\nThe test will verify that:\n- The server is running on port 8888 with HTTPS\n- Password authentication is enabled with the specified password\n- The sample notebook exists and contains the required cells\n\nYour response must be a JSON object that matches this schema:\n\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"Command\": {\n      \"additionalProperties\": false,\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"keystrokes\": {\n          \"description\": \"Keystrokes to execute in the terminal.

Install Jupyter Notebook with the necessary dependencies\n2. Configure the server to:\n   - Run on port 8888\n   - Accept connections from any IP address\n   - Use password authentication (set password to \"benchmarkpass\")\n   - Generate a self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS\n3. Create a sample notebook named \"test_notebook.ipynb\" in the current directory with:\n   - A markdown cell explaining what Jupyter Notebook is\n   - A code cell that defines and plots a simple sine wave using matplotlib\n4. Start the Jupyter server in the background so it's running when tests execute. You should allow Jupyter to run as root.\n\nThe test will verify that:\n- The server is running on port 8888 with HTTPS\n- Password authentication is enabled with the specified password\n- The sample notebook exists and contains the required cells\n\nYour response must be a JSON object that matches this schema:\n\n{\n  \"$defs\": {\n    \"Command\": {\n      \"additionalProperties\": false,\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"keystrokes\": {\n          \"description\": \"Keystrokes to execute in the terminal.
