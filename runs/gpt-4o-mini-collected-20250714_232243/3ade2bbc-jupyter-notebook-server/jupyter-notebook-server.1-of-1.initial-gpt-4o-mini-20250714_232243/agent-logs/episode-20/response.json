The server is accessible via the provided URL, but remains unsecured as the password setup has not been successfully completed yet.",
    "explanation": "To finalize the setup, we will avoid using the 'notebook.auth' module entirely. We will directly set the hashed password in the Jupyter configuration file using a manual hash creation method. This ensures that the notebook server is secure and properly configured without relying on the unavailable module.",
