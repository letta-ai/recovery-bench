However, there is a file named '_np_utils.pyx', which is typically a Cython file that should be compiled to generate the corresponding C file during the build process.",
    "explanation": "I will try running the Cython build process to generate the missing C files from the available Cython files. This may resolve the issue with the missing '_np_utils.c' file and allow the build to complete successfully. Then, I will attempt to re-run the build command for the extension modules.",
