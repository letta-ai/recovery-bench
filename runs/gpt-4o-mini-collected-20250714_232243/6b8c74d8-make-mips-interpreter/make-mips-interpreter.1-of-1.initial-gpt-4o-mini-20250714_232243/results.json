    "instruction": "I have provided /app/doomgeneric_mips, a MIPS elf file, along with doomgeneric/, the corresponding source code. Please implement a MIPS interpreter complete with handling system calls called vm.js so that I can run `node vm.js` and this should run the MIPS file and read/write any files as necessary. Running this file should result in saving the frames as they are rendered, one at a time. I will check that you booted doom correctly, and check that the first frame is correctly created and saved.",
