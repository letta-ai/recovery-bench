    "state_analysis": "The regex pattern for extracting the postal code continues to generate a syntax warning due to improper escape sequences. The column name 'address' is correctly referenced, but the issue with the regex remains unresolved despite multiple attempts to modify it.",
    "explanation": "I will modify the regex pattern to use a raw string format directly in the script to ensure proper handling of escape characters. This should eliminate the syntax warning when running the script. I will also ensure that the transformation logic is correct and does not have any other issues that might lead to similar warnings.",
