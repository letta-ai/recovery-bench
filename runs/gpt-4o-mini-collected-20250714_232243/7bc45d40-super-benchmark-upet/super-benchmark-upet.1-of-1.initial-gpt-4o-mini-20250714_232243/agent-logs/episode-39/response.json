However, the expected output file (results.json) has not been created in the specified results directory, which remains empty. This suggests that the output handling in the training process might not be configured correctly to save results.",
    "explanation": "Since the results file is still not being generated, we need to ensure that the training script is set to save outputs properly. We will examine the script for any output settings and verify that the output directory is writable. We will also attempt to rerun the training script without any conflicting parameters, focusing on ensuring that results are saved correctly.",
