    "state_analysis": "The installation of Cython continues to fail due to issues with generating metadata. The 'transformers' module is also missing, indicating that the installation of necessary dependencies has not been successful. Results.json has not been created as the training process has not executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since installation issues are persisting with Cython and causing a blockage in setting up the environment, we can try installing a version of Cython from a pre-compiled wheel that is compatible with the current setup. Additionally, we will ensure that all required modules, including 'transformers', are installed properly. This will allow us to run the training script successfully without encountering missing module errors.",
