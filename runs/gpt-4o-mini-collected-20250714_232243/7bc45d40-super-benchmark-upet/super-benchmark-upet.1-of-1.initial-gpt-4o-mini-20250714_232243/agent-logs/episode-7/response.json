    "state_analysis": "The installation attempts for Cython are still failing due to the same issues with generating metadata. The environment is not able to install necessary dependencies, which prevents the execution of the training script. The 'datasets' module is still missing and results.json has not been created as the training process has not run successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since the installation of Cython is persistently failing, we should consider cleaning the environment and reinstalling Cython along with the other requirements in a fresh state. This can help clear any cached data that might be causing conflicts. We will also ensure that we are using the latest version of pip and setuptools, as sometimes outdated versions can lead to these issues. We will perform these steps and then attempt to run the training script again.",
