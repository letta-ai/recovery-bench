However, the expected output file (results.json) has not been created in the specified results directory, which remains empty. This indicates that the output handling in the training script may not be properly configured to save results correctly.",
    "explanation": "Since the results file is still not being generated, we will verify the output directory and check the training script to ensure it saves results in the correct path. We will also attempt to run the training script again without any additional output parameters to simplify the execution. We will check for any logging or result-saving configurations that might need adjustment.",
