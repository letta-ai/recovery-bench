Previous attempts to install Cython failed due to issues with generating metadata. The 'datasets' module is still missing, and results.json has not been created because the training script has not been executed successfully yet.",
    "explanation": "Since the installation is still ongoing and possibly stalled, we will send a command to interrupt the current process if it does not finish soon. After that, we will attempt to install Cython using a different approach, such as installing a pre-built wheel from PyPI, and then proceed with the installation of requirements and running the training script.",
