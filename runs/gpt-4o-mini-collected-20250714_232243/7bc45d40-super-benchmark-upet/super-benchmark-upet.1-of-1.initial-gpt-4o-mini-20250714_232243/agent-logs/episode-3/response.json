The previous installation attempts failed due to issues with generating metadata for Cython, but a new attempt is currently in progress. The 'datasets' module is still not installed, and results.json has not been created as the training process has not yet executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "We will wait for the current Cython installation command to complete. After it finishes, we will check if the installation was successful and then proceed to install the requirements and run the training script again. If the installation times out again, we may need to explore alternative solutions for installing Cython.",
