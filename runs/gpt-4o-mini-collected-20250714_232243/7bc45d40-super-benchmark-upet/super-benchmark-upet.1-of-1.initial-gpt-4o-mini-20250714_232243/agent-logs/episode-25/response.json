    "state_analysis": "The training script encountered an ImportError because the name 'StableDropout' cannot be imported from the specified module in the transformers library. This suggests that the version of the transformers library being used may not include the 'StableDropout' class or it has been moved or renamed in newer versions. Results.json has not been created since the training process could not execute successfully.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this issue, we will check the version of the transformers library currently installed and see if it supports the required imports. If necessary, we will downgrade the transformers library to a version that is compatible with the UPET repository. We will then rerun the training script after ensuring that all dependencies are properly aligned.",
