    "state_analysis": "The installation of Cython fails repeatedly due to metadata generation issues, even within a virtual environment. The 'datasets' module remains unavailable, and results.json has not been created because the training script has not executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since the installation of Cython is consistently failing and blocking progress, we will consider the possibility of using a different approach to install dependencies for the UPET repository. We can manually clone the repository, install dependencies via a requirements file, and see if there are any specific instructions in the repository that might help resolve the installation issues. We will attempt to install a specific version of Cython that has been known to work in similar environments and run the training script thereafter.",
