    "state_analysis": "The training script executed successfully and downloaded the necessary model weights from Hugging Face. However, the output indicates that the path provided for results.json is incorrect as it is being recognized as a directory rather than a file. This means that while the model training likely completed, the results were not saved correctly to the intended file.",
    "explanation": "To correct the output issue, we need to ensure that the training script is indeed saving the results to a file named results.json within the specified output directory. We will check the contents of the output directory to confirm the saved results, or we may need to adjust the output directory and filename parameters to ensure proper saving.",
