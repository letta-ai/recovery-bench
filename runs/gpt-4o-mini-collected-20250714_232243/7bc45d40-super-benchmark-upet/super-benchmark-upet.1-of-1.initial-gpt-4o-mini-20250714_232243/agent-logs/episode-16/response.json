This indicates that Docker is not installed or not accessible from within the virtual environment. The 'datasets' module is still not installed, and results.json has not been created as the training script has not executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since Docker is not available, we will revert to attempting to install the necessary dependencies directly in the virtual environment. We can try using a different method to install Cython and ensure that all dependencies are met. Additionally, we can directly install the 'datasets' module before running the training script to avoid the missing module error.",
