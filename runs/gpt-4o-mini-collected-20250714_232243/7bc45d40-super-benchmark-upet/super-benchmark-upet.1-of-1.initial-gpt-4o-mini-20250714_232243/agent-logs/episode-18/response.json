    "state_analysis": "The installation of Cython continues to fail due to issues with generating metadata, preventing the installation of necessary packages. The 'torch' module is also missing, indicating that the installation of PyTorch has not been successful. Results.json has not been created because the training process has not executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "Since the installation issues with Cython are blocking progress and now we have missing dependencies such as 'torch', we will attempt to install PyTorch directly along with Cython and ensure all dependencies are installed correctly. We will also check for any specific installation instructions for PyTorch that might help us resolve the issues.",
