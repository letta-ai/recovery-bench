The 'datasets' module is still missing, and results.json has not been created since the training process has not been executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "To bypass the ongoing issues with Cython, we will attempt to install a pre-built wheel for Cython directly from PyPI. Following that, we will install the remaining requirements and run the training script again. If this fails, we may need to investigate the specific Cython version or dependencies that are causing the problem.",
