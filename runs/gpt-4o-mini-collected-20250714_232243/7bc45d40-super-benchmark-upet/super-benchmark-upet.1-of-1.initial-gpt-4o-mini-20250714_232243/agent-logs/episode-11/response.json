    "explanation": "Given the persistent issues with Cython, we will try a different approach by installing a specific pre-built wheel for Cython that is known to work. Additionally, we will ensure that all other dependencies related to the UPET repository are installed correctly. We will also check if there are alternative instructions for setting up the environment based on the repository's documentation.",
