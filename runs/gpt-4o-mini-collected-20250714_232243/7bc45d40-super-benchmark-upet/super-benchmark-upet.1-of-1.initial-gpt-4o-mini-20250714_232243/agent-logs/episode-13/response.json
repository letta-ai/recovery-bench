    "state_analysis": "The installation of Cython continues to fail due to issues with metadata generation. The 'datasets' module is still not installed, and results.json has not been created because the training script has not executed successfully. The repeated failures indicate a persistent issue with the Cython installation process.",
    "explanation": "Given that Cython installation issues persist, we will consider an alternative approach by using a Docker image that already has the necessary dependencies installed, including Cython. This can help us bypass the installation errors. If a suitable image is available, we can set up the environment from there and run the training script directly. We will proceed to create a new Docker container with the required setup and attempt to run the training script within that environment.",
