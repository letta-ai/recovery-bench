    "state_analysis": "The installation of Cython continues to fail due to issues with generating metadata. The 'datasets' module is present, but there is an ImportError indicating that 'load_metric' cannot be imported from the 'datasets' module. This suggests that the version of the datasets library may not be compatible with the code being executed. Results.json has not been created because the training process has not executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "To resolve the ImportError with the 'datasets' library, we will check if we need to downgrade or upgrade the datasets package to a specific version that is compatible with the UPET repository. We will also ensure that Cython is properly installed to avoid any further blocks. We will attempt to install a compatible version of the datasets library and rerun the training script.",
