    "state_analysis": "The installation of Cython continues to fail due to issues with generating metadata, even in a new virtual environment. The 'numpy' module is also missing, which indicates that the installation of necessary dependencies has not been successful. Results.json has not been created because the training process has not executed successfully.",
    "explanation": "Given the ongoing issues with Cython, we can try installing a binary wheel for a specific version of Cython that is known to work, or we can attempt to install the required packages individually to identify which dependency is causing the failure. We will first check if there are any specific installation commands for Cython that can help us resolve the issue. If that fails, we will install numpy and other dependencies directly, then try to run the training script again.",
