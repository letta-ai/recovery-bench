    "state_analysis": "The training script encountered a ValueError due to an unrecognized argument '--save_results_file', which indicates that this argument is not defined in the argument parser of the script. Additionally, results.json has not been created or is incorrectly referenced, as it was previously identified as a directory rather than a file. This suggests that the output handling needs to be clarified.",
    "explanation": "To address the argument issue, we will remove the '--save_results_file' parameter and ensure we are properly specifying the output directory. We will also check if the results are being saved to a file within the results directory. After making the necessary adjustments, we will rerun the training script.",
