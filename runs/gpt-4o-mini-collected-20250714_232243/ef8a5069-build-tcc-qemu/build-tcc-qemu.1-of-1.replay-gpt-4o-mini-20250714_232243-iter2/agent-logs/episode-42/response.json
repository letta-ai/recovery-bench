    "state_analysis": "The QEMU environment is still unresponsive with repeated login failures and inability to execute commands. This indicates a significant issue with the current session and setup.",
    "explanation": "At this point, it is clear that the QEMU environment is not functioning as intended and cannot proceed with the task. The best course of action is to terminate the QEMU session entirely and ensure that it starts fresh without any prior issues. This will allow us to create the necessary directories and perform the required installations without complications. I will provide the commands to exit the current session and restart QEMU with the correct parameters.",
