    "explanation": "Since the current QEMU session is not functioning as expected and cannot process any commands, it is necessary to clear this session and restart it entirely. This will provide a fresh environment to work with and avoid the complications faced previously. I will provide the commands to exit the current session and restart QEMU with the correct parameters.",
