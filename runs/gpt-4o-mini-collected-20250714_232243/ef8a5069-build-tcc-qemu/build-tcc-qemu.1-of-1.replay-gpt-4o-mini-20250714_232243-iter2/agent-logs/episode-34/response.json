    "state_analysis": "The terminal environment remains unresponsive, with repeated login failures and inability to execute commands. This indicates that the QEMU session is still experiencing issues.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent failure to interact with the QEMU environment, the best course of action is to forcefully exit and restart the entire QEMU session. This will help clear up any issues that have accumulated and allow for a fresh start. I will provide the commands to terminate the current session and start a new QEMU session with the correct parameters. However, since previous attempts to execute commands have failed, we will ensure that we reset everything entirely before proceeding.",
