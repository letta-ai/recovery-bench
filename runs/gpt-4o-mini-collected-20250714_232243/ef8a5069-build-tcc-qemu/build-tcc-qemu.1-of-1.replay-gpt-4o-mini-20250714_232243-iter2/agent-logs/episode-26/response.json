    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to be unresponsive, with repeated failures to execute commands and repeated login prompts. The QEMU environment is clearly not functioning as intended, preventing further progress towards compiling tcc and preparing the ISO.",

The best course of action is to reset the entire QEMU session and start over.
