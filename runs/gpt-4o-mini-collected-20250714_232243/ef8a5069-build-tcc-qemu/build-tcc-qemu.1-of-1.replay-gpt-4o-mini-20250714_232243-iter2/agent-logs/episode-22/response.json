    "explanation": "Given the repeated issues with the environment, let's try to exit QEMU altogether and start fresh with a new session. We can also ensure that any necessary directories are created from our local machine or setup script instead of within this limited shell. This will allow for a clean start without the complications faced previously. I'll provide the commands to execute these steps once logged back in.",
