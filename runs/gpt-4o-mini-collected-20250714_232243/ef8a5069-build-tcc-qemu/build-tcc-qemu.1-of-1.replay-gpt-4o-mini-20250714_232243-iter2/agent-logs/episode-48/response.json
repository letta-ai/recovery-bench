    "state_analysis": "The QEMU environment is still unresponsive, with repeated login failures and inability to execute commands. The session appears to be stuck in a loop of login prompts and failures, indicating a critical issue.",

This involves terminating the current QEMU instance and starting it again with the correct parameters.
