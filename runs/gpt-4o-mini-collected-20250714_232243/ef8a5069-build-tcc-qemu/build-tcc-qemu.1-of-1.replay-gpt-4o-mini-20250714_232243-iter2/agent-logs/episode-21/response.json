    "state_analysis": "The terminal has become unresponsive once again, and commands are timing out. The environment does not support the standard package manager or some basic operations, leading to repeated issues.",
    "explanation": "At this point, it seems the current QEMU environment might be too limited to accomplish the task as intended. We may need to consider either recreating the Docker container with a more fully-featured base image or using an alternative method to access a working version of tcc. However, let's attempt one more time to create the necessary directory structure and set up the environment for tcc before considering other options. I'll provide the commands to create the '/tmp/tcc_iso' directory and prepare the ISO again, but this time without waiting for responses as they have been timing out.",
