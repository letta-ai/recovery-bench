    "state_analysis": "The terminal is completely unresponsive, and the login attempts are failing repeatedly. This indicates that the QEMU environment is stuck and cannot process commands or handle logins properly, leading to a blocked state.",
    "explanation": "Since the current attempts to interact with the QEMU environment are not yielding any progress and are instead causing a cycle of errors, it is critical to terminate the current session entirely and start over. To exit this state, we will need to reset the QEMU session and ensure a clean start without the previous complications. I will provide the commands to force an exit and start QEMU anew with the correct parameters.",
