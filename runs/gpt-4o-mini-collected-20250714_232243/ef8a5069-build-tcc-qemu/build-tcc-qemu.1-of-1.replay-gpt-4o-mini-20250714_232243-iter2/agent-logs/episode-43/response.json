    "explanation": "Since the current QEMU session is not functioning as expected, it is necessary to terminate it entirely and restart with a fresh configuration. This will help clear any issues that have built up and provide a clean slate for further operations. I will provide the commands to exit the current session and start QEMU again with the correct parameters, ensuring a fresh environment to work with.",
