    "state_analysis": "The QEMU environment is still unresponsive, with persistent login failures and inability to execute commands. The session is locked in a loop of login prompts and incorrect password messages, indicating a critical issue with the environment.",
    "explanation": "Since the current QEMU session is not functioning and all attempts to log in and execute commands are failing, it is essential to terminate this session and restart it completely. This will allow us to start fresh without the complications faced previously. I will provide the commands to exit the current session, terminate QEMU, and then restart it with the correct parameters.",
