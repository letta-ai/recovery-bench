    "state_analysis": "The commands entered after logging in show confusion between attempting to execute commands and entering the login prompt. It appears that the QEMU environment is not responding as expected, and there are repeated issues with command execution.",
    "explanation": "Since this environment has proven to be problematic for setting up tcc and the ISO, we need to consider an alternative approach. It might be best to prepare the environment in a more capable shell or environment. If possible, restarting the Docker container with a more complete base image may resolve these issues. For now, I will provide a set of commands to exit the current environment and restart QEMU with a clean slate.",
