    "explanation": "Since previous troubleshooting steps have not yielded results, I will attempt to restart the entire Docker service from the host machine, if access allows, and check the overall system resources to see if there are any limitations affecting Docker's performance. This will involve checking CPU, memory, and disk space utilization to ensure there are sufficient resources available for Docker to operate normally.",
