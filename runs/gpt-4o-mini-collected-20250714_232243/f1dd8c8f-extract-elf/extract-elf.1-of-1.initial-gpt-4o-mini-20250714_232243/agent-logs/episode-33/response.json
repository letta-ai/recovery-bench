This ongoing issue across multiple commands suggests a fundamental problem with the host system or the Docker daemon, preventing any command execution.",
    "explanation": "Since the system is not responding to basic commands and Docker appears to be malfunctioning, I will now attempt to forcibly restart the Docker service from the host terminal if possible. If Docker does not respond or if the issue persists, I may need to consider a complete system reboot or further investigation into system logs and resources.",
