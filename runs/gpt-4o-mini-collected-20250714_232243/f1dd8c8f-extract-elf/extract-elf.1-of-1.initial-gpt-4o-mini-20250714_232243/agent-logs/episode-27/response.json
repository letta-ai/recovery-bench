    "state_analysis": "The command to check memory usage has timed out, indicating that the system or Docker environment remains unresponsive. This persistent failure to execute basic commands suggests a critical issue with the Docker installation, the host system, or possibly resource exhaustion.",
    "explanation": "Given that previous troubleshooting steps have not resolved the issue, I will take a more drastic approach by stopping Docker entirely and then restarting the Docker daemon along with checking if there are any lingering processes or resources that could be causing the unresponsiveness. After restarting the daemon, I will attempt to run a new container and check for the presence and functionality of the 'a.out' binary.",
