    "state_analysis": "The command to check the Docker service status has timed out once again, indicating that the Docker daemon is still unresponsive. This prolonged issue suggests a critical failure in the Docker setup or possibly the host system itself, which is preventing any interaction with Docker commands.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to troubleshoot the Docker environment have failed, the next step will be to check the overall system's health directly from the host machine. This includes checking CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk space. If these resources appear to be constrained or if there are any error messages, they will need to be addressed before Docker can function properly again.",
