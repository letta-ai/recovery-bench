This ongoing issue points to a fundamental problem with the Docker installation or the host system, preventing any interaction with Docker commands.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to troubleshoot the Docker environment have failed, the next step will be to check the overall system resources directly from the host machine. This includes checking CPU, memory, and disk space usage to see if any of these resources are exhausted. If necessary, I may also need to consider a full system restart at this point.",
