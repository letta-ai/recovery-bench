This repeated failure suggests there may be a serious issue with the Docker installation, the host system, or insufficient resources preventing commands from executing.",
    "explanation": "Since system commands continue to time out, I will consider restarting the Docker service again from the host machine, as well as checking for any existing Docker processes that may be hanging. If the service does not respond, I will need to evaluate the host system's resource allocation and overall health more thoroughly, potentially considering a complete system reboot as a last resort.",
