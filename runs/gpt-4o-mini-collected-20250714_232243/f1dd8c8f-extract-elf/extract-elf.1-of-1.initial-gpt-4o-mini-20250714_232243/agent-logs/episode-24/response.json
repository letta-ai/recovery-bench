    "state_analysis": "The command to check the Docker service status has timed out, indicating that the terminal environment is still unresponsive. This consistent timeout suggests a deeper issue with the Docker daemon or the host system, affecting not only command execution but also the ability to retrieve system status.",

This may resolve any underlying issues causing the Docker commands to fail. If the issue persists, further investigation into the host system's resources and Docker installation will be necessary.",
