    "explanation": "Since previous troubleshooting steps have not resolved the issue, I will now consider restarting the Docker daemon directly from the host system if access allows, and check the overall system resources to see if there are any limitations affecting Docker's performance. If the Docker daemon does not respond or if the issue persists, I will need to consider a complete system reboot or further investigation into system logs and resources.",
