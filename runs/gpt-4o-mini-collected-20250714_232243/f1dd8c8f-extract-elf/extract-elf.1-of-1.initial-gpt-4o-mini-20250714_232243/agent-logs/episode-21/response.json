This consistent issue suggests that there may be a problem with the Docker image or the underlying file system that is causing commands to fail.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to access the 'a.out' file and run commands have been unsuccessful, I will create a brand new Docker image from the base image used in the container. This will ensure a clean environment without any previous configurations that may be causing issues. After creating the new image, I will run a new container and check for the presence of the 'a.out' file again.",
