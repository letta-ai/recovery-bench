    "explanation": "I will verify if the Docker image is correctly set up by checking if the 'a.out' file exists in the intended directory. I will also check if there is an issue with permissions that may be preventing access to the file. Additionally, I will confirm that the Docker container is properly running and mounted with the correct volume. If everything seems correct, I will attempt to run the binary file directly to see if it executes without any issues.",
