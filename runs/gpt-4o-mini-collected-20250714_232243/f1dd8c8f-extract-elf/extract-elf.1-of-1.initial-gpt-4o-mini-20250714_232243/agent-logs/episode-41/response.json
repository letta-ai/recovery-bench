    "state_analysis": "The command to check the Docker service logs has timed out once again, indicating that the Docker daemon is still unresponsive. This persistent failure to execute commands suggests a critical problem with the Docker installation or the host system, preventing any command execution and access to logs.",
    "explanation": "Since the system continues to be unresponsive to Docker commands, I will now attempt to check the overall resource utilization of the host system directly from the terminal. This includes checking CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space. If these resources are constrained, they may be affecting Docker's ability to function properly.",
