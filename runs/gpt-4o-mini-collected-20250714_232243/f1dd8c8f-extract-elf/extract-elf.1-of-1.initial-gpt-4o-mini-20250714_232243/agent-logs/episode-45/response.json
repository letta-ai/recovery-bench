    "state_analysis": "The command to check the status of the Docker service has timed out again, indicating that the Docker service may still be unresponsive after the reinstallation. This could be due to underlying issues with the Docker installation or the host system itself that remain unresolved, preventing any command execution.",
    "explanation": "Since previous attempts to troubleshoot and reinstall Docker have not resolved the issue, I will now focus on checking the system resources and logs directly from the host environment. This includes checking for any resource constraints (CPU, memory, disk space) or errors that may be impacting Docker's functionality. If necessary, a complete system reboot may be required to clear any issues affecting Docker.",
