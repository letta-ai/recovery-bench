    "state_analysis": "The attempts to find and kill the process using port 80 have failed due to the absence of necessary commands like `lsof` and `fuser`. Port 80 remains in use, preventing Lighttpd from starting. Only the `grep` command is visible in the process list for port 80, which indicates that no actual service is occupying the port, but it is still reported as busy.",
    "explanation": "We will restart the Docker container to reset the network stack and clear any phantom processes that may be occupying port 80. After restarting, we will immediately try to start Lighttpd again.",
