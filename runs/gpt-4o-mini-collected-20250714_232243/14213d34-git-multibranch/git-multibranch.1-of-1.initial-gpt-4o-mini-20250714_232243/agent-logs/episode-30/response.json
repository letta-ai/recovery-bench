The tmux session is inactive, indicating that the environment is locked up and cannot process further actions. This suggests a critical failure in the operational environment.",

This will clear any issues with Docker and allow for a fresh start. After the restart, I will re-enter the Docker container to configure Lighttpd and ensure it starts correctly.",
