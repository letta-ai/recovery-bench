    "explanation": "Since the terminal is completely unresponsive and previous attempts to execute commands have failed, the only viable action is to manually restart the host system. This will reset the environment and clear any issues preventing command execution. Once the system is back online, I will re-enter the Docker container to configure Lighttpd correctly.",
