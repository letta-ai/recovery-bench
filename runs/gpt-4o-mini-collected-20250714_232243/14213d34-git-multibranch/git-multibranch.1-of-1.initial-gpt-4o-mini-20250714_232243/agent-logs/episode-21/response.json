Previous attempts to stop or restart the Docker container have failed, and the Lighttpd server remains in a state where it cannot start due to port 80 being reported as in use.",

This will clear any locks or conflicts. After restarting the Docker service, I will re-enter the container and check the Lighttpd configuration again.",
