    "state_analysis": "The Docker container is apparently unresponsive, and previous commands to restart the container have timed out. The terminal is unable to execute commands properly, and the attempt to exit the tmux session has also failed, indicating a deeper issue with the terminal environment. The port conflict with Lighttpd on port 80 persists, and no active processes are visible that could be using that port.",
    "explanation": "To resolve the issues, I will forcefully terminate the Docker container from an external terminal and then restart it. After the restart, I will re-enter the container and configure Lighttpd again. This process should clear any phantom processes occupying port 80 and allow Lighttpd to start successfully.",
