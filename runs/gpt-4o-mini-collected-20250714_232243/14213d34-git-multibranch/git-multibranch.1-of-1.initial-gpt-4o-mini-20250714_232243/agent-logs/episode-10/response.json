    "state_analysis": "The previous commands did not identify any processes using port 80 other than the grep command itself. This indicates that while port 80 is reported as being in use, no active service is shown occupying it, which is causing continuous issues when trying to start Lighttpd. The situation is likely caused by a lingering process or a misconfiguration in Lighttpd.",
    "explanation": "We will use the `fuser` command to find and kill any process using port 80. This command will help us identify the actual PID and then we can terminate it properly. After freeing the port, we will start Lighttpd again.",
