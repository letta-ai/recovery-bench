    "state_analysis": "The Lighttpd server failed to start because port 80 is still reported as in use, despite attempts to kill any processes. The Docker container was exited, and the session has ended, which indicates that the commands will not proceed further without restarting the terminal environment.",
    "explanation": "To resolve the issue, we need to restart the Docker container and then re-enter the terminal session to ensure that all configurations are applied properly and that no other processes are occupying port 80. After the restart, we will check the services again and attempt to start Lighttpd.",
