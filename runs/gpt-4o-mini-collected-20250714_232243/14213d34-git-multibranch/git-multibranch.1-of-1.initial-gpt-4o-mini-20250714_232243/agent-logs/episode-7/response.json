    "state_analysis": "Lighttpd continues to fail to start because port 80 is in use, preventing it from binding to port 8443. This indicates that there is likely another service running on port 80, which must be stopped before Lighttpd can start successfully. The SSL configuration appears to have been resolved, but the server is still unable to start due to the port conflict.",
    "explanation": "We will check for processes using port 80 and try to kill them if they are not essential for the current setup. After clearing the port, we will attempt to start Lighttpd again and test the connection to port 8443.",
