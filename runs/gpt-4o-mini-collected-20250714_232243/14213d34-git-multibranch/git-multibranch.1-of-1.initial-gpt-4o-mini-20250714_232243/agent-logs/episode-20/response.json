The tmux session is inactive, indicating a complete hang-up in the current environment. The Docker container may still be running but is inaccessible due to the session issues.",
    "explanation": "Since all attempts to interact with Docker are timing out and the terminal is no longer functioning, the best course of action is to exit the current environment entirely and restart the Docker service or the host machine if necessary. After restarting, we will re-enter the container to set up Lighttpd properly without any port conflicts.",
