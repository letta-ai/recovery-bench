    "state_analysis": "The command to kill the process using port 80 failed because the PID was not specified correctly. The only process listed is the grep command itself, indicating there are no other processes running on port 80, which is unexpected given that Lighttpd still cannot start due to the port conflict. This suggests that another service may still be using port 80, or there may be a misconfiguration in Lighttpd.",
