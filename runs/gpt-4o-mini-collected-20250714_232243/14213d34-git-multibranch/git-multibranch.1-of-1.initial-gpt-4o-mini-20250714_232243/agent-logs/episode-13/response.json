    "state_analysis": "The Docker container appears to be in a state where commands are timing out, and the previous exit command has already ended the session. The terminal is no longer accepting commands properly, which is likely due to the session being inactive or the container being unresponsive. The Lighttpd server cannot start due to persistent issues with port 80 being reported as in use, even though no other process seems to occupy it.",
    "explanation": "We will ensure that the Docker container is properly restarted and then re-enter the terminal session to execute the necessary commands for Lighttpd configuration. Once inside, we will start Lighttpd after confirming no services are occupying port 80.",
