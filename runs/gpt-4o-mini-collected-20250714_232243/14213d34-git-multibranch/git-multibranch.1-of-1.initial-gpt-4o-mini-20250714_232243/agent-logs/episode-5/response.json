    "state_analysis": "Lighttpd was unable to start because it could not read the private key from the specified SSL certificate file. Additionally, the `lsof` command is not available in the current environment, which prevents us from checking which process is using port 80.",
    "explanation": "We will need to check the paths and permissions of the SSL certificate and key files to ensure they are correct and accessible. After that, if necessary, we can create a new self-signed certificate that includes both the certificate and key in the same file. Finally, we will attempt to start Lighttpd again.",
