    "state_analysis": "Lighttpd still cannot start because it is trying to bind to port 80, which is in use. The process using port 80 has been identified, but the commands to kill it have failed due to the lack of a proper PID format. Therefore, Lighttpd cannot start on port 8443 as it is not yet free.",
    "explanation": "We will use `netstat` to identify the process using port 80 and then utilize the `ps` command to find the PID for that process and kill it. After freeing up port 80, we will attempt to start Lighttpd again.",
