    "state_analysis": "The terminal session is entirely unresponsive, and the command to reboot the system has timed out without executing. The Docker service and the terminal environment seem to be in a locked state, preventing any further actions from being taken.",
    "explanation": "At this point, the only option left is to forcibly terminate the host system or the Docker daemon process from an external terminal if accessible. This will clear any locks or residual processes that are causing the unresponsiveness. Once the system is back up, I can re-enter the Docker container and proceed with configuring Lighttpd properly.",
