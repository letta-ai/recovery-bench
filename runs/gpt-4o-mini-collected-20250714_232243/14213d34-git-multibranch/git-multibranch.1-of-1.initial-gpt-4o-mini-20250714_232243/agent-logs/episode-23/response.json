The tmux session is inactive, indicating that the terminal environment is locked and cannot process further commands. The Docker service may also be frozen or unresponsive, making it impossible to manage containers or services effectively.",

After restarting, I will enter the container again to configure Lighttpd properly and ensure it starts without issues on port 8443.",
