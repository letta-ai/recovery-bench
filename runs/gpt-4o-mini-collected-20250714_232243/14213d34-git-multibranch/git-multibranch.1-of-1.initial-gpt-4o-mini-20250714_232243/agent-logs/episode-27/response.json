This indicates that the entire system may be hung or locked up, making it impossible to execute any commands. The situation is critical, and the system needs to be restarted to recover functionality.",

Once the system is back up, I will re-enter the Docker container to reconfigure Lighttpd and resolve the previous issues with port conflicts.",
