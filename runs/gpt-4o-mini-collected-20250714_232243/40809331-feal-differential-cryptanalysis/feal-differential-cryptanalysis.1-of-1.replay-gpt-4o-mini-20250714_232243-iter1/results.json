    "instruction": "The file feal.py implements a FEAL-like encryption function. Implement a chosen plaintext attack that recovers the value of key[5].\n\nYour attack should be implemented in attack.py, and should implement a function called attack(encrypt_fn) and it should return the uint32 value of key[5]. Your attack should run in less than 30 seconds.\n(Each of the 6 round keys is derived from a 16 bit seed.\nYou still can't brute force the entire keyspace but this should\nmake it easier for you to do a differential attack that recovers the round key.)",
