    "explanation": "Given the state of the database and the lack of backups, we may need to consider alternative recovery options or tools, such as using a hex editor to manually inspect the file for recoverable data. However, this process requires careful handling. Alternatively, we could check for any other relevant logs or files that might help us in the recovery process.",
