There are no backups or logs available, and a recovery status file has been created to notify users of the data loss and request any necessary data for reconstruction.",
    "explanation": "Given that previous approaches have not yielded results, we can try using a different SQLite recovery tool, or we can explore alternative methods for data recovery. For now, let's attempt to use the `dd` command to create a byte-level copy of the corrupted database file, which may help in using specialized recovery tools later if necessary.",
