    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, and attempts to stop the Docker container have failed to execute. The output consistently indicates that there is no active tmux server, which confirms that the terminal is stuck in a non-responsive state. This ongoing issue prevents any actions from being taken to address the implementation errors in the PointEnv class.",
    "explanation": "Since all command attempts have failed to regain control and there is no response from the terminal, the next step must be to manually restart or reset the host system or the Docker container through the appropriate management interface. This will clear the current unresponsive state, allowing me to start fresh. Once the environment is reset, I can access the terminal and work on fixing the implementation issues.",
