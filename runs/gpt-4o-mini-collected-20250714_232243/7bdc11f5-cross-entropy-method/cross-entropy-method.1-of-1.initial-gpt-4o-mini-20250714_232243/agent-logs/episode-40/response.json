    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and attempts to execute a shutdown command have failed again. The output indicates that there is no active tmux server, confirming that the terminal is stuck in a non-responsive state, likely due to being trapped in an unresponsive process like nano or a similar blocking state. This prevents any further attempts to address the implementation issues with the PointEnv class.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to regain control have failed and I cannot execute any commands, I recommend performing a physical reset of the host system or the Docker environment if accessible. This is the only way to clear the current unresponsive state. Once the system is restarted, I can access the terminal and continue working on the implementation and testing.",
