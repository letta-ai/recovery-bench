    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains stuck in the nano editor, and all attempts to exit have so far failed, including commands meant to kill the process. The current output indicates that the PointEnv class methods are returning None instead of valid outputs, causing significant test failures. This situation is preventing any further debugging or implementation adjustments.",
    "explanation": "To regain control of the terminal, I will attempt to detach the tmux session. This will allow me to exit the nano editor forcefully. After detaching, I will create a new session to continue working on the implementation and tests. Once I have control again, I can check the state of the code and proceed with corrections.",
