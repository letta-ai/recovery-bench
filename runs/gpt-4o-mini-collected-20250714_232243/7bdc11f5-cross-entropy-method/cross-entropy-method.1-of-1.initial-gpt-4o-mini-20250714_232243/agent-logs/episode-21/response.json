    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still completely unresponsive, and all attempts to terminate or restart the Docker container have failed. The system is likely stuck in an uninterruptible state, possibly due to the nano editor or another blocking process that does not allow any commands to execute. This makes it impossible to address the issues with the PointEnv class implementation directly.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot regain control of the terminal or execute any commands, the next logical step is to forcibly kill the entire Docker container from the host machine (if available) or to exit the Docker container entirely. Once the container is stopped, I can restart it and regain access to the terminal environment to continue working on the implementation and tests.",
