    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still completely unresponsive, and attempts to execute a shutdown command have also failed. The output indicates that there is no active tmux server, confirming that the terminal is stuck in a non-responsive state, likely due to being trapped in an unresponsive process like nano or a similar blocking state. This prevents any further attempts to address the implementation issues with the PointEnv class.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent issues and the inability to regain control through commands, the next step must be to forcibly restart the entire Docker environment or the host system through the management interface, if accessible. This will clear the current unresponsive state and allow me to start fresh. Once the environment is reset, I can access the terminal and work on fixing the implementation issues in the PointEnv class.",
