    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, and all previous attempts to restart the Docker container have failed. The consistent output of 'no server running on /tmp/tmux-0/default' suggests that the environment is stuck in a state where it cannot process commands. This situation prevents addressing the implementation issues with the PointEnv class.",
    "explanation": "Given the total lack of responsiveness from the terminal and the failure of all previous commands, the next step is to attempt a hard reset of the Docker service from the host system's terminal or management interface (if accessible). This is the last resort to clear the current state and regain access to the terminal environment. After the reset, I will verify the state of the PointEnv class implementation and make necessary corrections.",
