    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains unresponsive, and attempts to restart the Docker container using the command have timed out. The output indicates that there is no active tmux server, which reinforces the idea that the terminal is stuck in the nano editor or a similar non-responsive state. The ongoing test failures indicate that the implementation of the PointEnv class needs urgent attention, but I still cannot proceed without regaining terminal control.",
    "explanation": "Given the inability to exit the current state, I will attempt to forcefully stop the current Docker container using the Docker command. This should allow me to regain control of the environment. Once the container is stopped, I can then start it again and access the terminal for further actions.",
