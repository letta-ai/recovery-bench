    "state_analysis": "The terminal continues to be unresponsive, and attempts to stop the Docker container have also failed. The consistent messages indicate that there is no active tmux server, which confirms that the terminal is stuck in a non-responsive state. The ongoing issues with the implementation of the PointEnv class require attention, but I cannot address these until I regain terminal access.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to regain control through commands have failed, the only remaining option is to manually restart or reset the host system or the Docker container through physical access or the management interface. This will clear the current stuck state, allowing me to start fresh. Once the system is operational again, I will check the PointEnv class implementation and address any issues found.",
