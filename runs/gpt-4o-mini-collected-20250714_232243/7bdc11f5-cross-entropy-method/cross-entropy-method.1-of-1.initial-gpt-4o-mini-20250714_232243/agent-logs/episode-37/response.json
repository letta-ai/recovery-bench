    "state_analysis": "The terminal is completely unresponsive, and attempts to restart the Docker container have failed. The consistent output indicates no active tmux server, confirming that the terminal is stuck in a non-responsive state. The critical issues with the implementation of the PointEnv class require immediate attention, but I cannot proceed without regaining terminal access.",
    "explanation": "Given the persistent issues and inability to regain control through commands, the next step must be to forcibly restart the entire Docker environment or the host system through the management interface, if accessible. This will clear the current unresponsive state and allow me to start fresh. Once the environment is reset, I can access the terminal and work on fixing the implementation issues in PointEnv.",
