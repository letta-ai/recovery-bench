    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, and attempts to execute a shutdown command have failed again. The output continues to indicate that there is no active tmux server, confirming that the terminal is stuck in a blocking state, likely within an unresponsive process like nano or similar.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to regain control of the terminal have failed and I cannot execute any commands, I recommend performing a physical reset of the host system or the Docker environment through the appropriate management interface or physical access. This is necessary to clear the current blocking state and regain terminal access. Once the system is restarted, I can check the implementation of the PointEnv class and address any issues found.",
