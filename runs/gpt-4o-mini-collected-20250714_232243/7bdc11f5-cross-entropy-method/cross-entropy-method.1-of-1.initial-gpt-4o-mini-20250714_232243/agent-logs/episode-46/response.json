    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still completely unresponsive, and attempts to restart the Docker container have failed. The consistent output indicates that there is no active tmux server, confirming that the terminal is stuck in a non-responsive state. This ongoing issue prevents any actions from being taken to address the implementation issues with the PointEnv class, which require urgent attention.",
    "explanation": "Given that all previous attempts to regain control have failed, the next logical step is to perform a hard reset of the host system or the Docker environment through the appropriate management interface or physical access. This will clear the current unresponsive state and allow me to regain terminal access. Once the system is operational again, I can check the implementation of the PointEnv class and address any issues found.",
