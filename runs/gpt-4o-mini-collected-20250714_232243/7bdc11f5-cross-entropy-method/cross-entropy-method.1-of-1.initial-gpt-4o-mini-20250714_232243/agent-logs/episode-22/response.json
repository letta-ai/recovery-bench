    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and attempts to stop and remove the Docker container have timed out. The output indicates that there is no active tmux server running, which confirms that the current session has completely stalled. The ongoing issues with the implementation of the PointEnv class need immediate attention, but I cannot proceed without regaining terminal access.",
    "explanation": "Since direct commands to manage the Docker container are not succeeding, I will attempt to break out of the current state by detaching from the session directly from the host system (if applicable). If that does not work, I will need to consider terminating the entire Docker instance or restarting the host machine to regain control. After regaining access, I can proceed to check the implementation and address the errors.",
