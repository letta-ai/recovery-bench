    "state_analysis": "The terminal is completely unresponsive, and attempts to execute a shutdown command have also failed, with no response from the system. The consistent output indicates that there is no active tmux server, confirming that the terminal is stuck in a blocking state, likely within an unresponsive process like nano.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to regain control of the terminal have failed and there is no way to execute commands, the next step should be to forcibly restart the host system from an external management interface or physical access. This is the only remaining option to reset the environment and regain access to the terminal interface. Once restarted, I can verify the implementation of the PointEnv class and address the existing issues.",
