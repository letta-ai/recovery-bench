    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains unresponsive, and all attempts to exit or regain control have failed. There is no active tmux server, indicating that the system may be stuck in the nano editor without any way to break out of it. The persistent output shows multiple test failures related to the PointEnv class, indicating that the implementation needs urgent correction, but I cannot proceed without regaining terminal control.",
    "explanation": "Since I cannot exit or regain control through normal commands in the terminal, I will send a command to restart the Docker container. This will clear the current state and allow me to start fresh. Once the container is restarted, I can access the terminal and work on the implementation and tests again.",
