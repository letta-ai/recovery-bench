As a result, I am unable to regain control through typical tmux commands. The output continues to show multiple test failures related to the PointEnv class, indicating that the implementation requires immediate attention and debugging.",
    "explanation": "I will now attempt to open a new terminal session manually (if possible) or restart the Docker container entirely to regain terminal access. Once I have control, I can check the implementation files and re-run the tests to identify the issues with the PointEnv class methods.",
