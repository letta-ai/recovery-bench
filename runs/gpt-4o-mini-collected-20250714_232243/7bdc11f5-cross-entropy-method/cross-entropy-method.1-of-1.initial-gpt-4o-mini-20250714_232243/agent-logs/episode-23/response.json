    "state_analysis": "The terminal is entirely unresponsive, and attempts to interrupt the current process using Ctrl + C have failed. The output indicates that there is no active tmux server, confirming that the session is stuck, likely in the nano editor or another blocking state. The ongoing test failures suggest that the implementation of the PointEnv class needs urgent attention, but I cannot address these issues until I regain terminal access.",
    "explanation": "Given the inability to regain control of the terminal through normal commands, I will attempt to restart the entire system. This is a last resort action to ensure that I can gain access to the terminal and address the implementation errors. Once the system is restarted, I can access the terminal and continue working on the implementation and tests.",
