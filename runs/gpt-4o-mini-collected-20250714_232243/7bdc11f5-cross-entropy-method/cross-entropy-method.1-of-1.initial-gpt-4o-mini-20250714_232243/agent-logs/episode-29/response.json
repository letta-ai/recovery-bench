    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and all attempts to execute commands, including a reboot, have failed. The consistent output indicating that there is no active tmux server suggests that the shell is completely stuck, likely in an interactive process like nano that is not responding to input. This situation prevents me from addressing the issues with the PointEnv implementation or any other tasks.",
    "explanation": "Since all command attempts have failed and I cannot regain control of the terminal, the only option remaining is to physically restart the Docker container or the host system. This is necessary to clear the current unresponsive state and regain access. Once the system is restarted, I will be able to access the terminal to continue working on the implementation and fix the issues with the PointEnv class.",
