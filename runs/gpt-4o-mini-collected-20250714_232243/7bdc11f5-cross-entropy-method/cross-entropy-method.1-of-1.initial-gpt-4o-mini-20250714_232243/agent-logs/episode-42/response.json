    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains completely unresponsive, and all attempts to restart the Docker container have failed. The consistent output indicates that there is no active tmux server, which confirms that the terminal is stuck in a non-responsive state, likely trapped within a process that is not responding to commands. This situation prevents any further attempts to address the implementation issues with the PointEnv class.",
    "explanation": "Since all previous attempts to regain control have failed, the next logical step is to perform a hard reset of the Docker environment or the host system. This will clear the current unresponsive state and allow me to regain terminal access. Once the system is operational again, I can check the PointEnv class implementation and address any issues found. I will now attempt to shut down the Docker container forcefully.",
