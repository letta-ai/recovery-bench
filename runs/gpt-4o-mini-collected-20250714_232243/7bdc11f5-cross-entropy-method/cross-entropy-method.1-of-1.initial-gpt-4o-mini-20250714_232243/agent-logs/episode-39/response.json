    "state_analysis": "The terminal is still unresponsive, and attempts to kill the Docker container or execute any commands have timed out. The consistent output of 'no server running on /tmp/tmux-0/default' indicates that there is no active tmux session, confirming that the terminal is stuck in a non-responsive state. This situation prevents any further actions to address the implementation issues with the PointEnv class.",
    "explanation": "Since all command attempts have failed to regain control of the terminal and no actions can be executed, the next step is to forcibly restart the host or Docker environment through the appropriate management interface or hardware reset, if accessible. This is necessary to clear the current unresponsive state and regain access to the terminal. After the reset, I can access the terminal and continue working on the implementation and tests.",
