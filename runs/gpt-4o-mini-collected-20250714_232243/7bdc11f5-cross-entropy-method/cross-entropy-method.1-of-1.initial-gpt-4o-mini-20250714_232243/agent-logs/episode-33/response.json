    "state_analysis": "The terminal remains unresponsive, and attempts to kill the Docker container have failed. The consistent output indicates that there is no active tmux server, reinforcing the idea that the terminal is stuck in a non-responsive state. This situation prevents any further attempts to address the issue with the PointEnv class implementation.",
    "explanation": "Since all commands to manage the Docker environment have failed, the only remaining option is to restart the entire system from an external management interface, if available. This is necessary to clear the current unresponsive state and regain terminal access. Once the system is restarted, I will be able to access the terminal and work on fixing the implementation issues.",
