    "state_analysis": "The training script has failed again with the same `AttributeError`, indicating that the issue with the 'torch' library persists despite attempts to reinstall it. This suggests a recurring problem likely related to the environment configuration or the specific version of 'torch'.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we will try a clean installation of a different compatible version of 'torch' and its dependencies using the 'pip' command with a version specification that is known to be stable. In addition, I will ensure that the environment is clean before installation. Let's try installing 'torch' version 1.11.0 this time.",
