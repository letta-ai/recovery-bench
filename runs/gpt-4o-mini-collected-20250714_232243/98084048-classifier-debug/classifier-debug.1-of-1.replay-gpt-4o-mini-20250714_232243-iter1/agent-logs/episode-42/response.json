The last run of the training script indicates that 'torch' is not currently installed, resulting in a `ModuleNotFoundError`. This continues to indicate an issue with the installation or compatibility of 'torch'.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we will try to install the most recent version of 'torch' available in the environment, which is 2.7.1, and ensure that it is installed correctly. We will also check for any potential issues with the installation process. After installation, we will rerun the training script to see if the issue persists.",
