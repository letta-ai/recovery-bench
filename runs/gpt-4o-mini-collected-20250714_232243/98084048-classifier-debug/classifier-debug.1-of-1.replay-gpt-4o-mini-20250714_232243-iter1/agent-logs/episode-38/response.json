    "state_analysis": "The training script has failed again with the same `AttributeError`, indicating that the issue with the 'torch' library persists despite reinstalling it. This suggests a recurring problem likely related to the environment configuration or the specific version of 'torch'.",
    "explanation": "To troubleshoot this further, let's try to completely remove the 'torch' package and its dependencies, and then install a version that is known to be stable and compatible with the existing environment. We will try installing 'torch' version 2.1.0 this time, as it may bypass the circular import issue while still providing the necessary functionality.",
