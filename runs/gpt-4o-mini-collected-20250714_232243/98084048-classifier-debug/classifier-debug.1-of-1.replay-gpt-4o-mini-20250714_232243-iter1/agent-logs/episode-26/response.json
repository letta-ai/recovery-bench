    "state_analysis": "The attempt to downgrade 'torch' to version 1.13.0 failed because that version is not available for the current environment, and the most recent version 2.7.1 is still causing issues. The last attempt to run the training script indicates that 'torch' is not currently installed after the uninstallation.",
    "explanation": "To resolve the issue, we will attempt to install a different version of 'torch' that is compatible with the current environment. We will try installing version 2.0.0, which should provide a more stable base while still being recent enough for the code to work correctly. After installation, we will rerun the training script.",
