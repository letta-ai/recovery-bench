    "state_analysis": "The training script failed again with the same `AttributeError`, indicating that the issue with the 'torch' library persists, likely due to a circular import. This suggests that there is a fundamental problem with the 'torch' installation or its compatibility with the current environment.",
    "explanation": "To resolve this, we will attempt to create a new virtual environment from scratch without any remnants of previous installations. This will ensure that all packages are freshly installed without any previous conflicts or corruptions. We will also check for any potential issues with the installation process. Let's proceed with reinstalling the virtual environment and installing a different version of 'torch' that is known to be stable, specifically 1.10.0.",
