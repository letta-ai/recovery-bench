    "explanation": "To address this, we will attempt to completely uninstall 'torch' along with its dependencies, and then install a fresh version that is known to be stable. We will also clean up the environment to ensure no remnants are left that could cause conflicts. Let's try installing 'torch' version 2.4.0 this time.",
